The **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)** is a standardized system of symbols used to represent the sounds of spoken language. It provides a consistent and universally recognized way to transcribe speech sounds, regardless of the language.

### Structure of the IPA

The IPA is divided into three main categories of sounds:

1. **Consonants**: Produced by obstructing airflow in various ways and places in the vocal tract.
2. **Vowels**: Produced without significant airflow obstruction, with variations in tongue position and lip shape.
3. **Diacritics and Suprasegmentals**: Indicate finer details, such as stress, tone, and intonation.
