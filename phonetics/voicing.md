# **Voicing**

#### **Introduction**:
- **Voicing** refers to whether the vocal cords (vocal folds) vibrate or not during the production of a sound. 
- It is a key feature in distinguishing consonants and plays a vital role in the sounds of many languages.

#### **Types of Voicing:**

1. **Voiced Sounds**: 
    - These occur when the vocal cords come together and vibrate as air passes through them.
	    - **Examples**: /b/ (bat), /d/ (dog), /g/ (go), /z/ (zebra), /v/ (vase).
    - **Characteristics**: Voiced sounds tend to be deeper or "buzzier" due to the vibration of the vocal cords.
3. **Voiceless Sounds**: 
    - These occur when the vocal cords are apart, allowing air to flow without vibrating them.
	    - **Examples**: /p/ (pat), /t/ (top), /k/ (cat), /s/ (snake), /f/ (fish).
    - **Characteristics**: Voiceless sounds are sharper or more "hissy" since there is no vocal cord vibration.

#### **How to Detect Voicing**:

1. **Feeling Vibration in Your Throat**:
    
    - Place your fingers on your throat while pronouncing the sound.
        - **Voiced sounds**: You’ll feel a vibration because the vocal cords are vibrating.
        - **Voiceless sounds**: You won’t feel vibration because the vocal cords are apart.
2. **Listening for the Difference**:
    
    - **Voiced sounds**: Often sound fuller, deeper, or buzzier due to vocal cord vibration.
    - **Voiceless sounds**: Often sound sharper, crisper, or hissy, with no vibration.
3. **Using a Stethoscope or Phone**:
    
    - You can use a stethoscope or place your phone on your throat to detect vibrations. Voiced sounds will show up more clearly in the recording.
4. **Acoustic Analysis**:
    
    - In linguistics, **spectrograms** or waveform analysis can visually differentiate voiced and voiceless sounds.
        - **Voiced sounds**: Have a periodic wave pattern (due to vibration).
        - **Voiceless sounds**: Have an aperiodic or irregular wave pattern.

#### **Voicing in Consonant Pairs**:

Many consonants come in pairs where one is voiced and the other is voiceless. The difference between them is purely the presence or absence of vocal cord vibration:

- **/b/** (voiced) vs. **/p/** (voiceless)
- **/d/** (voiced) vs. **/t/** (voiceless)
- **/g/** (voiced) vs. **/k/** (voiceless)
- **/z/** (voiced) vs. **/s/** (voiceless)

#### **The Role of Voicing in Language**:

- **Word Distinction**: Voicing is important for distinguishing words. For example, "bat" vs. "pat" differ only in the voicing of the initial consonant.
- **Voicing Assimilation**: Voicing can change depending on neighboring sounds. For instance, in English, **dogs** is pronounced with a voiced /z/ instead of a voiceless /s/ due to the preceding voiced /g/.

#### **Voicing and Vowels**:

- Vowels are almost always voiced (they involve vocal cord vibration). However, the surrounding consonants can affect the **pitch** and **quality** of vowels.

#### **Voicing and Speech Sound Changes**:

- **Devoicing**: Some languages have processes where a normally voiced consonant becomes voiceless due to its position in the word or surrounding sounds.
- **Voicing Assimilation**: Consonants may take on the voicing of adjacent sounds, either becoming voiced or voiceless.
