# Vowel Sounds
### Introduction
- Vowel sounds are speech sounds produced with an open vocal tract, allowing air to flow freely from the lungs through the vocal cords and out of the mouth without significant obstruction. 
- They are the core of syllables, carrying pitch, stress, and intonation in speech. 
- Vowels are almost always **voiced**, meaning they are produced with vocal cord vibration.
