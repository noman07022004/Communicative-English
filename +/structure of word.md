### Introduction
- Word structure refers to the internal makeup of a word. It describes how words are formed, based on the components they contain. These components include [[root|roots]], [[prefix|prefixes]], [[suffix|suffixes]], and other meaningful parts. Words can be simple or composite, depending on their structure.
	1. ***Simple Words:***
		- Simple words are those that cannot be divided into smaller meaningful parts. They consist of only one unit of meaning (a [[root]] word) and do not contain any [[affix|affixes]] (prefixes, suffixes, or infixes). For example,
			- _and_, _the_, _on_, _book_, _dog_
		- These words are the basic building blocks of a language.
		- They stand alone and do not rely on any other word parts for their meaning.

	2. ***Composite Words:***
		- Composite words are made up of two or more smaller meaningful parts, such as a [[root]] word combined with one or more [[prefix|prefixes]], [[suffix|suffixes]], or other roots. These smaller parts have distinct meanings that contribute to the overall meaning of the word. For example,
			- _unhappy_ = _un-_ (prefix meaning "not") + _happy_ (root)
			- _unsure_ = _un-_ (prefix meaning "not") + _sure_ (root)
			- _unlock_ = _un-_ (prefix meaning "reversing") + _lock_ (root)
			- _replay_ = _re-_ (prefix meaning "again") + _play_ (root)
		- These words are formed by adding one or more affixes or combining two or more words.
		- Composite words are often flexible and can take on new meanings depending on the [[affix|affixes]] or root combinations used.
