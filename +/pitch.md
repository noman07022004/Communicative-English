**Pitch** refers to the perceived highness or lowness of a sound and is determined by the frequency of the sound waves. In speech, pitch is related to the vibration of the vocal cords: faster vibrations produce a higher pitch, while slower vibrations produce a lower pitch.

In linguistics, **pitch** is a crucial aspect of prosody, which includes stress, rhythm, and intonation. Pitch plays a significant role in distinguishing meaning, structuring sentences, and conveying emotions or intentions.

### Key Aspects of Pitch in Speech

1. **Physical Basis**:
    
    - Pitch is determined by the **frequency** of vocal cord vibrations, measured in hertz (Hz).
    - Higher frequency = higher pitch; lower frequency = lower pitch.
2. **Linguistic Functions**:
    
    - **Intonation**: The rise and fall of pitch across a sentence. It conveys meaning, emotion, or grammatical structure.
        - Rising intonation: Indicates a question or uncertainty (_Are you coming?_).
        - Falling intonation: Indicates a statement or finality (_I’m here._).
    - **Stress**: Pitch contributes to word or sentence stress by making stressed syllables or words slightly higher in pitch.
        - Example: _I WANT a new car_ (pitch rises on "want").
    - **Tone**: In tonal languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese), pitch changes on syllables determine word meaning.
        - Example: In Mandarin, _ma_ with a high-level tone means "mother," but with a falling tone, it means "to scold."
3. **Pitch Range**:
    
    - Varies by speaker and context.
    - **Wide pitch range**: Often used in emotional or expressive speech.
    - **Narrow pitch range**: Often used in monotone or subdued speech.
4. **Types of Pitch Patterns**:
    
    - **Level pitch**: Maintains a steady pitch, often seen in robotic or emotionless speech.
    - **Rising pitch**: Indicates questions or uncertainty.
    - **Falling pitch**: Indicates statements or commands.
    - **Rising-falling pitch**: Shows emphasis or surprise.
    - **Falling-rising pitch**: Often used to signal politeness or hesitation.
5. **Pitch and Emotion**:
    
    - Higher pitch: Associated with excitement, fear, or urgency.
    - Lower pitch: Associated with calmness, authority, or sadness.

### Examples of Pitch in English

1. **Intonation in Sentences**:
    
    - Rising: _Did you see the DOG?_ (indicates a question).
    - Falling: _I saw the DOG._ (indicates a statement).
2. **Pitch in Word Stress**:
    
    - In _PREsent_ (noun), the first syllable is higher in pitch.
    - In _preSENT_ (verb), the second syllable is higher in pitch.
3. **Pitch in Emotion**:
    
    - _I CAN’T believe it!_ (excitement, rising pitch on "CAN’T").
    - _I can’t BELIEVE it._ (disbelief, falling pitch on "BELIEVE").

### Importance of Pitch

- It enhances **clarity** and **expression** in speech.
- It helps convey **grammatical structures** (questions vs. statements).
- It reflects **emotions** and **attitudes**.
- In tonal languages, pitch changes directly affect word meaning.

Mastering pitch can greatly improve spoken communication, making it more engaging and accurate.
