A **morph** is the physical or actual representation of a morpheme in speech or writing. It is the way a morpheme is expressed in a particular word. While a **morpheme** is an abstract unit of meaning, a **morph** is its concrete form.

### Key Points About Morphs:

1. **One Morpheme, One Morph**: In simple cases, a morpheme corresponds to a single morph.
    
    - Example: The word _cats_ has two morphs: _cat_ (the root) and _-s_ (plural suffix).
2. **Allomorphs**: When a single morpheme has different morphs depending on context.
    
    - Example: The plural morpheme in English has three morphs:
        - _/s/_ as in _cats_.
        - _/z/_ as in _dogs_.
        - _/Éªz/_ as in _buses_.
3. **Zero Morph**: When a morpheme is not physically represented.
    
    - Example: In _sheep_ (plural), there is no visible plural morph.
4. **Portmanteau Morph**: A single morph represents multiple morphemes.
    
    - Example: _is_ combines subject (third person singular) and present tense.

### Example Breakdown:

- Word: _unhappily_
    - Morphs: _un-_, _happy_, _-ly_.
    - Morphemes: Negative prefix (_un-_), root (_happy_), and adverbial suffix (_-ly_).

In short, **morphs** are the tangible realizations of the abstract units called **morphemes**.
