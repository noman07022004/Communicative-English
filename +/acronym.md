### Introduction
- **Acronym** is a type of abbreviation formed by taking the initial letters of a set of words and combining them into a new word that is pronounced as a single term. For example,
	- **NASA**: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
	- **UNESCO**: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
	- **RADAR**: Radio Detection and Ranging
	- **SCUBA**: Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus
	- **LASER**: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
	- **FOMO**: Fear of Missing Out (informal, commonly used on social media)

### Basic Concepts

### Key Characteristics of Acronyms:

- **Initial letters**: Acronyms are usually formed from the first letters of each word in a phrase.
- **Pronounced as words**: The resulting acronym is pronounced as a single word (e.g., _NASA_, _radar_).
- **Familiarity**: Acronyms are often used to simplify long or complex terms, making them easier to remember or reference.
- **Common in everyday language**: Many acronyms have become so familiar that they are used as regular words.

### Examples of Acronyms:

- **NASA**: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
- **UNESCO**: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
- **RADAR**: Radio Detection and Ranging
- **SCUBA**: Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus
- **LASER**: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
- **FOMO**: Fear of Missing Out (informal, commonly used on social media)
- **NIMBY**: Not In My Backyard
- **scuba**: Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus

### Acronyms vs. Initialisms:

- **Acronyms**: Formed from initial letters and pronounced as a word (e.g., _NASA_, _scuba_).
- **Initialisms**: Formed from the initial letters, but each letter is pronounced individually (e.g., _FBI_ = Federal Bureau of Investigation, _ATM_ = Automated Teller Machine).

### In Summary:

**Acronyms** are created by taking the first letters of words in a phrase and combining them to form a new word that is pronounced as a single unit. They are commonly used for efficiency, especially in technical, academic, or organizational contexts.
