### Introduction
- Stress is not simply "stressed" vs. "unstressed" but can have multiple levels, particularly within words.
- ***Three Primary Levels of Stress:***
	1. ***Primary Stress:***
	    
	    - The strongest type of stress, often marked by pitch movement (e.g., falling from high to low).
	    - Example: _around_ → `ə'raʊnd` (primary stress on the second syllable).
	2. ***Secondary Stress:***
	    
	    - Weaker than primary stress but stronger than unstressed syllables.
	    - Marked in transcription with a low vertical line (ˌ).
	    - Examples:
	        - _photographic_ → `ˌfəʊtə'ɡræfɪk`
	        - _anthropology_ → `ˌænθrə'pɒlədʒi`
	3. ***Unstressed:***
	    
	    - The absence of prominence.
	    - Examples:
	        - First syllable of _around_ → `ə`
	        - Unstressed syllables with vowels like /ə/, /ɪ/, /ʊ/, or syllabic consonants are less prominent (e.g., _poetic_ vs. _pathetic_).



### Basic Concepts
- Stress is not simply "stressed" vs. "unstressed" but can have multiple levels, particularly within words. Analyzing stress in isolated words helps clarify its placement and levels, though it is somewhat artificial since words are rarely spoken in isolation.
- **Primary stress**: The strongest emphasis in a word.
	- Example: _comPUter_ (primary stress on the second syllable).
- **Secondary stress**: A weaker emphasis than primary stress but stronger than unstressed syllables.
	- Example: _phoTOgraphic_ (secondary stress on the first syllable, primary stress on the third syllable).
- **Unstressed syllables**: These are pronounced with less emphasis and often contain reduced vowels.
	- Example: _aBOUT_ (unstressed first syllable).
- **Tertiary Stress (Optional):**
	- A proposed weaker level of stress than secondary but stronger than unstressed syllables.
	- Example: _indivisibility_ →
	    - Primary stress: `ˈbɪl`
	    - Secondary stress: `ˌɪn`
	    - Tertiary stress: `ˌvɪ`
	    - Unstressed: other syllables.
	- However, tertiary stress adds complexity and is not widely adopted in standard transcription.


#### **Conclusion:**

English stress is primarily analyzed with three levels:

1. **Primary** (strongest)
2. **Secondary** (moderate)
3. **Unstressed** (weakest)

Optional tertiary stress may be noted in certain cases, but its inclusion is debated for practical transcription purposes.
