### Introduction
- **Etymology** is the study of the origin and history of words, tracing how their forms and meanings have evolved over time. 
- The word "etymology" itself has roots in Greek (_Ã©tymon_ meaning "original form" + _logia_ meaning "study"). It should not be confused with **entomology**, which is the study of insects.

### Basic Concepts
Greek and Latin are major sources of English vocabulary, often offering alternative ways to describe similar concepts. For example:

- **Mono-** (Greek) and **uni-** (Latin) both mean "one" and appear in words like _monocycle_ and _unicycle_.
- The Germanic root **otte-** provides another variation for "one" in words like _otte-cycle_ (rare usage).

Etymology reveals the rich and diverse history of English and helps us understand how new words enter the language. Many words now commonly accepted, such as _handbook_ (once criticized in the 19th century) or _aviation_ (condemned in 1909), were initially viewed as improper innovations.

Rather than seeing the creation of new words or uses as a decline in language standards, we can view it as evidence of the **creativity and adaptability** of language to meet the changing needs of its speakers.
