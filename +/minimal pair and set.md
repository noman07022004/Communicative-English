### According to the Text

- **Minimal Pair**:  
    A **minimal pair** is a pair of words that are identical in form except for one contrasting [[phoneme]] in the same position. The contrast in phonemes creates a difference in meaning.
    
    - **Example**:
        - **fan** and **van**: The only difference is the initial phoneme (/f/ vs /v/), which creates different meanings.
- **Minimal Set**:  
    A **minimal set** is a group of words that can be differentiated from each other by changing one [[phoneme]] (always in the same position) in each word.
    
    - **Example**:
        - **fan**, **van**, **man**, **pan**: Each word differs by only one phoneme in the same position (initial consonant).
