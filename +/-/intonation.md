### **Intonation and Its Role in Phonology**

Intonation is a key component of **suprasegmental phonology**, which includes aspects of speech that are not directly tied to individual segmental phonemes, such as **stress** and **intonation**. While stress, as covered in previous chapters, applies to syllables, intonation pertains to **pitch variation** across speech. This chapter focuses on understanding intonation and its linguistic significance.

---

#### **What is Intonation?**

Intonation refers to the **variation in pitch** during speech. Unlike segmental phonology (which deals with consonants and vowels), intonation operates at a higher level, affecting **syllables, words, and larger units** of speech.

Key aspects of intonation:

1. **Pitch Changes**: In normal speech, our pitch does not remain constant but varies. The task is to **analyze the pitch** and understand its functions within speech.
2. **Perception of Pitch**: Pitch is typically described as "high" or "low." These terms are somewhat arbitrary since one could choose other descriptors (e.g., "light" to "heavy"), but they serve as convenient markers on a **pseudo-spatial scale**.

---

#### **Linguistic Relevance of Pitch**

1. **Pitch Control**: Only those pitch variations under the speaker’s **control** are linguistically significant. For instance, while riding a horse, a speaker’s pitch may fluctuate uncontrollably due to movement. This pitch variation isn't of linguistic importance. However, a speaker may deliberately choose to raise or lower their pitch, and this decision can carry meaning in communication.
    
2. **Pitch vs. Fundamental Frequency**:
    
    - **Pitch** refers to the auditory perception of a sound's frequency (high or low).
    - **Fundamental frequency** refers to the rate of vibration of the vocal folds, which is measurable. This distinction is often blurred, with "pitch" used informally to refer to both the subjective sensation and the objective physical frequency.
3. **Perceptibility of Pitch Differences**: For pitch to be linguistically significant, it must be **perceptible** to the listener. Not all measurable differences in fundamental frequency are audible as pitch differences. Hence, speakers must control their pitch in a way that others can notice and interpret.

#### **Contrasts in Intonation**

In phonology, contrast is crucial to defining linguistic units. For example, the distinction between the phonemes /b/ and /p/ is clear in the contrast between words like "bin" and "pin." Similarly, in **intonation**, it’s important to identify whether pitch changes can create contrasts that alter meaning. If **intonation contrasts** are established, they can function similarly to segmental contrasts in speech.

For instance, consider:

- **Statement intonation**: A neutral or falling pitch at the end of a sentence.
- **Question intonation**: A rising pitch at the end of a sentence.

These two pitch patterns create a contrast that changes the function of a sentence. The challenge lies in identifying such contrasts and understanding how they contribute to the linguistic structure of speech.

---

#### **Summary**

Intonation plays an essential role in communication, especially in distinguishing meaning through variations in pitch. The significance of intonation arises from the speaker's ability to control pitch and from the listener’s ability to perceive pitch contrasts. In studying intonation, linguists are not concerned with arbitrary pitch variations but focus on those that carry **linguistic meaning** and contribute to contrasts within the language. The next chapters will delve deeper into the nature of these contrasts and their role in language use.


# Form and function in intonation
When studying intonation in English, two primary questions must be addressed:

1. **What can we observe when we study pitch variations?**
2. **What is the linguistic importance of these observed phenomena?**

These questions can be summarized as:

- **Form of Intonation**: What does the pitch of speech do? (i.e., how does pitch change?)
- **Function of Intonation**: What does the pitch variation mean or signal in communication?

To explore these, we start with **one-syllable utterances**, which are a simple way to understand intonation and its role in communication. Common examples of such utterances include words like "yes" and "no."

---

#### **Pitch Variation and Tone in One-Syllable Utterances**

The first observation about intonation is that pitch can either **stay constant** or **change** across an utterance. When studying pitch, we use the term **tone** to describe the overall behavior of pitch in speech. For example:

- **Level Tone**: The pitch remains steady throughout the syllable.
- **Moving Tone**: The pitch changes from one level to another.

In English, it is rare to hear a one-syllable word like "yes" or "no" with a **level tone**. Instead, English speakers tend to use **moving tones**, which are more dynamic and expressive. Common types of moving tones include:

- **Falling Tone**: The pitch starts high and drops to a lower level. This tone often signals a **definitive, final statement**. For example, "Yes" or "No" said with a falling tone often conveys certainty or finality.
    
- **Rising Tone**: The pitch starts low and rises to a higher level. This tone is often used for **questions**, such as when asking "Yes?" or "No?" to inquire or confirm something.
    

These variations in tone already suggest the **function** of intonation: the **choice of tone** reflects how the speaker wants the utterance to be interpreted, and the **listener** perceives the tone to understand the speaker’s intention.

---

#### **The Challenge of Defining the Function of Intonation**

In the past, phonetics researchers hoped to systematically define what each **intonation pattern** means, with the goal of teaching foreign learners of English specific rules for proper intonation use. However, it has become clear that this approach is not entirely feasible. While general rules for **intonation patterns** can be made, they are often too broad to serve as a comprehensive guide for practical use. Intonation in English is not simply governed by fixed rules.

Instead, learners of English must develop an ear for the intonation patterns used by native speakers. This is best achieved through **exposure** to **colloquial English** and regular **interaction** with native speakers. In fact, the best way to learn intonation is by mimicking how a child learns it—through **listening** and **imitating**.

Thus, advanced learners of English must train their ability to **recognize** and **replicate** the intonation of native speakers. While it is possible to master segmental pronunciation (the individual sounds of words) and stress patterns, acquiring natural intonation requires continuous exposure to how English is spoken in everyday contexts.

---

#### **Conclusion**

To summarize, understanding the **form** of intonation (how pitch changes) is essential to mastering English speech. However, its **function**—how these changes affect meaning and convey intention—requires much more than learning simple rules. To effectively use intonation, learners must engage in consistent listening and speaking practice with native speakers, which is the key to developing an intuitive understanding of English intonation patterns.


# Tone and tone languages
In the previous section, we discussed different types of **intonation** that can occur in one-syllable utterances like "yes" and "no." These include:

1. **Level Tone**: The pitch remains steady.
2. **Falling Tone**: The pitch drops from high to low.
3. **Rising Tone**: The pitch rises from low to high.

We used a simple notation system to represent these tones, with symbols placed before the syllables to indicate the type of tone:

- **Level tone**: _yes, _no
- **Falling tone**: Nyes, xno
- **Rising tone**: 'yes, /no

While this system can be expanded to show **high** and **low** levels of tone (e.g., **_yes** for low level and **-yes** for high level), English does not rely on such distinctions for meaning. In other words, changing the pitch in these examples doesn't change the fundamental meaning of "yes" or "no" in English. However, in many other languages, changing the pitch or tone of a word can **completely change its meaning**.

---

### **Tone Languages**

Languages in which tone plays a critical role in distinguishing word meanings are called **tone languages**. In these languages, the **pitch** or **tone** assigned to a syllable can determine the word's meaning. The meaning of a word may shift drastically with a change in tone.

#### Example of Tone in **Kono** (a language from West Africa):

- **High level tone**: _beq ('uncle')
- **Low level tone**: _buu ('horn')
- **Low level tone**: _beq ('greed')
- **High level tone**: _buu ('to be cross')

This shows how a **tone shift** from high to low (or vice versa) can alter the meaning of the same sequence of sounds. In **Mandarin Chinese**, for example, the word **"ma"** can take different meanings depending on its tone:

- **_ma** means "mother."
- **/ma** means "hemp."
- **xma** means "scold."

#### English vs. Tone Languages:

In contrast to **tone languages**, **English** does not use pitch variations to change the meaning of a word. Although **intonation** in English can change the **emphasis**, **emotion**, or **questioning tone**, it does not result in distinct meanings for the same word (unlike tone languages). For instance, English speakers can say **"yes"** with a falling tone (indicating certainty), or a rising tone (indicating a question), but the core meaning of the word "yes" does not change.

---

### **Conclusion: English vs. Tone Languages**

English is not a tone language, meaning that **intonation** in English serves more to convey emotions, intentions, and questions, rather than altering the word's inherent meaning. On the other hand, in **tone languages**, tone is an essential feature of the language, and altering the tone can change the very meaning of a word. Tone languages are widespread, spoken by large populations in **Southeast Asia**, **Africa**, and **Native American languages**, while English uses **intonation** to help convey additional nuance or emotion.

# Complex tones and pitch height
In the previous section, we discussed the **level**, **fall**, and **rise** tones used in English one-syllable utterances. However, English also features more complex tones, such as:

1. **Fall-Rise Tone**: The pitch first falls and then rises again. This tone is quite common in English and is used to convey various meanings, such as uncertainty, hesitation, or to soften a statement.
    
2. **Rise-Fall Tone**: The pitch starts low and rises before falling again. This tone is less common in everyday speech but may occur in specific contexts, such as when expressing surprise or when emphasizing a point.
    

---

### **Speaker’s Pitch Range and Intonation**

Each speaker has a **normal pitch range**, which includes:

- **Top level**: The highest pitch normally used by the speaker.
- **Bottom level**: The lowest pitch normally used by the speaker.

In regular, unemotional speech, the **intonation** generally stays within the lower part of the speaker's pitch range. However, when there is a need to express **strong emotions** or emphasis, speakers often extend their pitch range, using **extra pitch height**.

---

### **Emphasizing Pitch Height**

When expressing emphasis or strong emotions, a speaker may push their pitch beyond the normal range. For example:

- A **normal, unemphatic "yes"** might fall within the speaker's typical pitch range.
- A **strong, emphatic "yes"** might extend to the upper end of the pitch range, creating a more pronounced rise in pitch.

To visually represent this difference, the following symbols can be used:

- **\yes**: Indicates a normal "yes" within the regular pitch range.
- **tx yes**: Indicates an emphatic "yes" with extra pitch height.

### **Usage of Extra Pitch Height**

While many tones can be given extra pitch height, this is typically reserved for situations with **strong feelings**. Since this course focuses on **normal, unemotional speech**, the symbol for extra pitch height (represented by a vertical upward arrow) will be used sparingly.

---

### **Summary**

In summary, English has both **simple** (level, rise, fall) and **complex** (fall-rise, rise-fall) tones. Each speaker has a **normal pitch range**, and in situations of emphasis or strong emotions, speakers may use **extra pitch height**. This extra height adds depth and emphasis to speech, but is not always used in regular speech patterns.

# Some functions Of English tones
### **Functions of English Tones**

In the context of **English intonation**, different tones serve various linguistic functions. This section examines how tones can convey specific meanings in simple one-syllable utterances like "yes" and "no" when spoken in isolation.

---

#### **1. Fall Tone (xyes, xno)**

- **Function**: The fall tone is typically seen as **neutral** and conveys a sense of **finality** or conclusion.
- **Example**: If someone asks a question and the response is **xyes** or **xno**, it implies that the conversation is concluded and no further information is expected. This tone is often used when no more elaboration is needed.

---

#### **2. Rise Tone (zyes, zno)**

- **Function**: The rise tone suggests that **something more is to follow**. It can be seen as an **invitation to continue** or a prompt for further interaction.
- **Example 1**:
    - A: Excuse me.
    - B: **zyes** (implying "what do you want?").
- **Example 2**:
    - A: Do you know John Smith?
        
    - B: **zyes** (signaling the willingness to continue and perhaps provide more information).
        
    - Conversely, a **fall** would signal **finality**.
        
- **Function with "no"**:
    - A: Have you seen Ann?
    - B: **zno** (inviting A to explain why they are asking).

---

#### **3. Fall-Rise Tone (vyes, vno)**

- **Function**: The fall-rise tone often indicates **limited agreement** or a **response with reservations**. This tone conveys both **concession** and **hesitation**.
- **Example 1**:
    - A: I've heard it's a good school.
    - B: **vyes** (implying partial agreement but with reservations).
- **Example 2**:
    - A: It’s not really an expensive book, is it?
    - B: **vno** (signifying partial disagreement or uncertainty).

---

#### **4. Rise-Fall Tone (ayes, ano)**

- **Function**: The rise-fall tone is used to express **strong feelings** such as **approval**, **disapproval**, or **surprise**.
- **Example 1**:
    - A: You wouldn’t do an awful thing like that, would you?
    - B: **ano** (indicating disapproval or surprise).
- **Example 2**:
    - A: Isn’t the view lovely!
    - B: **ayes** (expressing strong approval or enthusiasm).

---

#### **5. Level Tone (_yes, _no)**

- **Function**: The level tone is used in contexts where the response is **routine**, **uninspiring**, or **boring**. It conveys a sense of **monotony** or **lack of emotion**.
- **Example**:
    - A teacher calling the names of students from a register might use the level tone. When a student's name is called, the response is likely to be **_yes**.
    - Similarly, when answering a series of **routine** questions (e.g., for an insurance policy), the response might be **_no** for questions like “Do you suffer from any serious illness?”

---

### **Tone Substitution and Flexibility**

Although we have described specific functions for each tone, it is important to note that no single tone is restricted to only one context. While certain tones may be **more likely** in particular situations, **tone substitution** is common, and the context plays a crucial role in determining which tone is most appropriate. The meaning of a tone can shift depending on the speaker's intent, emotion, and the overall conversation.

---

### **Conclusion**

The tones in English, from **fall** to **rise**, **fall-rise**, and **rise-fall**, all contribute to the **functionality** of the language in communicating **emotions**, **intentions**, and **interpersonal dynamics**. Understanding these subtle shifts in pitch is crucial for effective communication, as tones often carry more significance than the words themselves.

# Tones on other words

Now that we have explored tones in **one-syllable words** like "yes" and "no," we can extend this understanding to **polysyllabic words**. The tone on polysyllabic words is typically applied to the **most strongly stressed syllable**. This is important because the tone often coincides with the stress pattern in a word. Here’s how the different tones can be applied to words of varying syllabic lengths:

---

#### **1. Fall Tone (x)**

The **fall** tone typically conveys a **final**, **definitive**, or **certain** feeling.

- **Examples**:
    - **xstQP** (could imply finality or a conclusion)
    - **xcighty** (suggests a definitive statement)
    - **xgain** (could imply a definite action or conclusion)

---

#### **2. Rise Tone (/**)

The **rise** tone often signals a **question**, **uncertainty**, or an **invitation to continue**.

- **Examples**:
    - **/ surg** (suggesting a rising tone of inquiry)
    - **/ rally** (could imply a rising intonation, indicating a question or uncertainty)
    - **/ toznight** (a rising tone could suggest curiosity or question)

---

#### **3. Rise Tone on Lists**

When giving a list, speakers typically use the **rise tone** on each item until the last item, which has a **fall tone** to signal the end of the list. This pattern helps to indicate that the list is still ongoing.

- **Example**:
    - "You can have it in **'Ed**, **blue**, **zgcgn**, or **Nhlack**."
    - In this example, each item on the list is spoken with a rising tone, and the final item "Nhlack" is spoken with a falling tone, marking the conclusion of the list.

---

#### **4. Fall-Rise Tone (v)**

The **fall-rise** tone often conveys **uncertainty**, **hesitation**, or a **reservation**.

- **Examples**:
    - **v perhaps** (indicating a hesitant or uncertain agreement or suggestion)
    - **v nearly** (suggesting doubt or a reserved response)

---

#### **5. Rise-Fall Tone (a)**

The **rise-fall** tone often sounds **surprised**, **impressed**, or **emphatic**. This tone suggests a strong emotional reaction or unexpected response.

- **Examples**:
    - **a Qh** (a surprised or impressed reaction)
    - **a Algygly** (could express surprise or enthusiasm)
    - **a Ammense** (suggesting excitement or surprise)

---

### **Summary of Tone Applications on Words**

- **Fall Tone**: Finality or definiteness.
- **Rise Tone**: Questions, curiosity, or invitation to continue.
- **Rise Tone in Lists**: Continuation of items with a final fall tone at the end of the list.
- **Fall-Rise Tone**: Uncertainty, hesitation, or reserved agreement.
- **Rise-Fall Tone**: Surprise, emphasis, or strong emotional reaction.

By applying these tonal patterns, speakers of English can convey various nuances of meaning, ranging from certainty to hesitation or surprise, even within a simple word.
