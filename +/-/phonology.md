### Introduction
- **Phonology** is the branch of linguistics that studies the systematic organization, patterns, and mental representation of [[speech sound|speech sounds]] in a language.
- It focuses on the **abstract or mental** aspect of sounds rather than their physical articulation.
- Phonology is concerned with the **underlying design** or **blueprint** of sounds in a language, not the actual physical sounds. It explains how we mentally process and understand sounds in speech.
- Phonology relies on the theory of what speakers **unconsciously** know about the sound patterns in their language.
-  For example, 
	- the different pronunciations of the \[t] sound in words like "tar," "star," "writer," and "butter" are physically different but represent the same **[[phoneme]]** /t/ in English. These physical differences are not important to phonology, which focuses on the **mental representation** of the sounds.
- Phonology is more concerned with the **meaningful distinctions** between sounds, such as \[t], \[k], \[f], or \[b], because these differences create meaningful words. The phoneme /t/ in "tar" and /k/ in "car" are distinct and meaningful, while minor articulatory differences of \[t] sounds do not change the meaning.
- Phonology is a foundational area of linguistics that explores how sounds are structured and function within languages.
