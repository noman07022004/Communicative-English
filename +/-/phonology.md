### Introduction
- **Phonology** is the branch of linguistics that studies the systematic organization, patterns, and mental representation of [[speech sound|speech sounds]] in a language.
- It focuses on the [[abstract]] aspects of sounds, such as [[phoneme|phonemes]] (distinctive sound units) and their rules of interaction, rather than their physical production or acoustic properties.
- The smallest unit of sound that can distinguish meaning in a language.

### According to the book
- **Definition**:  
    Phonology is the study of the systems and patterns of speech sounds in a language. It focuses on the **abstract or mental** aspect of sounds rather than their physical articulation.
    
- **Key Points**:
    1. **Phonology vs. Physical Speech**:
        - The text explains that speech sounds vary widely in their physical production due to factors like shouting, illness, or other conditions. Despite this, we still recognize different versions of the same word as the same (e.g., "me").

    1. **Abstract Representation**:
        - Phonology is concerned with the **underlying design** or **blueprint** of sounds in a language, not the actual physical sounds. It explains how we mentally process and understand sounds in speech.

    1. **Mental Knowledge**:
        - Phonology relies on the theory of what speakers unconsciously know about the sound patterns in their language.

- **Example of Phonology**:
    - For example, the different pronunciations of the \[t] sound in words like "tar," "star," "writer," and "butter" are physically different but represent the same **phoneme** /t/ in English. These physical differences are not important to phonology, which focuses on the **mental representation** of the sounds.


- **Meaningful Sound Distinctions**:
    - Phonology is more concerned with the **meaningful distinctions** between sounds, such as \[t], \[k], \[f], or \[b], because these differences create meaningful words. The phoneme /t/ in "tar" and /k/ in "car" are distinct and meaningful, while minor articulatory differences of \[t] sounds do not change the meaning.

- **Conclusion**:
    - Phonology helps us recognize and interpret words based on their **abstract, mental representation** of sounds, even when the actual physical sounds vary in speech.

### Basic Concepts
#### 1. [[phoneme|Phoneme]]

- Phoneme is the abstract, mental representation of sound.
- A **phoneme** is the smallest unit of sound in a language that can change the meaning of a word. for example:
	-  /p/ and /b/ in "pat" and "bat" are phonemes in English.

#### 2. [[allophone|Allophones]]

- An **allophone** is a variation of a phoneme that occurs in different contexts but does not change the meaning of a word. For example,
	- The \[p] in "spin" (unaspirated) and the \[pʰ] in "pin" (aspirated) are allophones of the phoneme /p/ in English.
#### 3. [[complementary distribution|Complementary Distribution]]

#### 4. [[minimal pair and set|Minimal Pairs and Sets]]

#### 5. [[phonotactics|Phonotactics]]

#### 6. [[syllable|Syllables]]
#### 7. [[coarticulation effect|Coarticulation Effects]]

### **3. Phonological Rules**

Phonological rules explain how phonemes are realized as specific sounds (allophones) in given linguistic environments.

- **Assimilation:** One sound becomes similar to a neighboring sound.
    - Example: "input" often pronounced as [ɪnpʊt] → [ɪmpʊt].
- **Deletion:** A sound is omitted.
    - Example: "friend" pronounced as [frɛnd] → [frɛn].
- **Insertion (Epenthesis):** A sound is added.
    - Example: "athlete" pronounced as [æθliːt] → [æθəlit].
- **Metathesis:** Sounds are reordered.
    - Example: "ask" pronounced as [æsk] → [æks].

### **4. Suprasegmental Features**

These are properties of speech that extend over multiple segments (phonemes).

#### **Stress**

- **Definition:** The relative emphasis placed on syllables in words.
- **Example:** 'record (noun) vs. re'cord (verb).

#### **Intonation**

- **Definition:** The variation in pitch across a sentence, affecting meaning or emotion.
- **Example:** Rising intonation in a question: "You're coming?"

#### **Tone**

- **Definition:** Pitch variation that distinguishes words in tone languages.
- **Example:** In Mandarin, "ma" can mean "mother" (mā), "hemp" (má), "horse" (mǎ), or "scold" (mà).

#### **Length**

- **Definition:** The duration of sounds, which can distinguish meaning in some languages.
- **Example:** Japanese "kite" (きて, come) vs. "kiite" (きいて, listen).

### **5. Syllable Structure**

- **Syllable Components:**
    - **Onset:** The initial consonant(s) of a syllable.
    - **Nucleus:** The core vowel of a syllable.
    - **Coda:** The final consonant(s) of a syllable.
- **Types:**
    - Open syllables: End in a vowel (e.g., "go").
    - Closed syllables: End in a consonant (e.g., "cat").

### **6. Phonological Processes in Language Acquisition**

Children often simplify speech sounds as they learn to speak. These processes include:

- **Substitution:** Replacing one sound with another easier sound.
    - Example: "wabbit" for "rabbit."
- **Reduplication:** Repeating a syllable.
    - Example: "baba" for "bottle."
- **Cluster Reduction:** Simplifying consonant clusters.
    - Example: "pane" for "plane."

---

### **7. Phonological Variation**

Phonology can vary across dialects, languages, and speakers.

#### **Dialects**

- Regional variations may have different phonemic inventories or stress patterns.
- Example: British English often pronounces the "r" at the end of words less prominently than American English.

#### **Language Differences**

- Languages can have vastly different sound systems.
    - Example: English has 44 phonemes, while Hawaiian has only 13.

### **8. Theoretical Approaches**

#### **Generative Phonology**

- Developed by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle.
- Focuses on the rules and mental representations that underlie speech sounds.

#### **Optimality Theory**

- Proposes that linguistic outputs are the result of competing constraints.
- Example: A word’s pronunciation balances the need to be faithful to its underlying form and ease of articulation.

#### **Autosegmental Phonology**

- Analyzes features (like tone) as independent of segments, allowing for non-linear representations.

### **9. Applications of Phonology**

- **Speech Therapy:** Diagnosing and treating speech sound disorders.
- **Language Teaching:** Understanding phonology aids in teaching pronunciation.
- **Speech Recognition:** Improving software understanding of spoken language.
- **Linguistic Research:** Analyzing historical and modern language changes.

### **Conclusion**

Phonology is a foundational area of linguistics that explores how sounds are structured and function within languages. Its insights are crucial for understanding human communication, language acquisition, and the diversity of linguistic systems.
