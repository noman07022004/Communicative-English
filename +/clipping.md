### Introduction
- **Clipping** is a word-formation process where a longer word is shortened by removing one or more syllables, typically without changing its meaning. It involves shortening a word by cutting off parts of it.
-  The resulting word is often more casual or informal but retains the meaning of the original word. 
- ***Types of Clipping :***
	1. **Fore-clipping**: Removing the beginning of a word.
	    - Example: _telephone_ → _phone_.
	  
	1. **Back-clipping**: Removing the end of a word.
	    - Example: _advertisement_ → _ad_.
	    - Example: _mathematics_ → _math_.
		- Example: _laboratory_ → _lab_.
	    
	3. **Middle-clipping**: Removing parts from both the beginning and the end.
	    - Example: _influenza_ → _flu_.
	    - Example: _refrigerator_ → _fridge_.
