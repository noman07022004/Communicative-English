### Introduction
- Stress refers to the emphasis placed on certain syllables within words. For example:
	- The first syllable is stressed in _father_, _open_, _camera_.
	- The middle syllable is stressed in _potato_, _apartment_, _relation_.
	- The final syllable is stressed in _about_, _receive_, _perhaps_.
- **Marking Stress:**  
	- Stressed syllables are marked with a vertical line (') before the syllable in transcription:
		- 'father → `'fɑːðə`
		- po'tato → `pə'teɪtəʊ`
		- re'ceive → `rɪ'siːv`
- ***Factors Contributing to Prominence:***
	1. ***Loudness*:**
	    
	    - Stressed syllables are louder, but loudness alone has a weaker effect when not combined with other factors.
	2. ***Length*:**
	    
	    - Stressed syllables are longer in duration. This is a significant factor in perceiving prominence.
	3. ***[[pitch|Pitch]]*:**
	    
	    - Pitch relates to vocal fold vibration frequency and the musical notion of high/low notes.
	    - A change in pitch or adding pitch movement (e.g., rising/falling) strongly signals stress.
	4. ***Quality*:**
	    
	    - A vowel's distinctiveness compared to neighboring vowels enhances stress perception.
	    - In English, stressed syllables often contrast against weak syllables containing common vowels (e.g., ə, ɪ, u).


### Basic Concepts
**Approaches to Stress Analysis:**

1. **Production Perspective:**
    
    - Stress involves greater muscular energy, especially in muscles controlling air expulsion from the lungs.
    - Higher subglottal pressure and increased activity in vocal apparatus muscles are observed.
2. **Perception Perspective:**
    
    - Stress is perceived as _prominence_—a stressed syllable stands out compared to unstressed ones.



**Key Insight:**

- **Prominence** results from the combination of these four factors: loudness, length, pitch, and quality.
- **Pitch** and **length** are the most influential factors, while loudness and quality have lesser effects.
