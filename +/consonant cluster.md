### Introduction
- Consonant clusters refer to combinations of two or more consonants that occur together in the onset or coda of a syllable.
- **Onset Consonant Clusters**: In English, it's common for the onset to consist of more than one consonant.
	    
	- **Example**: In the word _stop_, the onset is the consonant cluster /st/.
	    - Other examples include: _black_, _bread_, _trick_, _twin_.
	- **Coda Consonant Clusters**: A coda can also consist of more than one consonant.
	    
	    - **Example**: In the word _post_, the coda is the consonant cluster /st/.
	- **Larger Onset Clusters**: English can have larger onset clusters, such as in words like _stress_ or _splash_, which have three initial consonants (CCC).
	    
	    - **Pattern**: In larger onset clusters, the first consonant is usually /s/, followed by a voiceless stop (/p/, /t/, /k/), and a liquid or glide (/l/, /r/, /w/).
	    - **Example**: _splash_ (/splæʃ/), _strong_ (/strɔŋ/), _scream_ (/skriːm/), _squeeze_ (/skwiːz/).-
	- **Phonotactics of Clusters**: Phonotactics describe the constraints on where and how consonant clusters can appear within syllables in a language. In English, certain clusters like /spl/ and /str/ follow regular patterns, whereas others may be less common or forbidden by the language's phonotactic rules.
