### Basic Concepts
1. ***==Recent Coinages==***
	1. **Function of Suffixes:**
	    
	    - Suffixes change a word’s class. For example:
	        - **-ism** (noun), **-ize** (verb).
	        - Example: **inform** → **informant** (verb → noun), **logical** → **logic** (adjective → noun).
	2. **New Suffixes and Coinages:**
	    
	    - New suffixes are often formed by slicing off parts of popular words and using them in a new context.
	    - **Examples**:
	        - **-gate** (from _Watergate_) refers to scandals (e.g., Irangate, Iraqgate).
	        - **-aholic** (from _alcoholic_) used for addiction-related terms (e.g., workaholic, shopaholic).
	        - **-athon** (from _marathon_) refers to endurance events (e.g., telethon, readathon).
	        - **-burger** (from _hamburger_) used for various types of food (e.g., cheeseburger, fishburger).
	        - **-ware** (from _hardware_) in tech terms (e.g., software, freeware).
	3. **Examples of Recent Suffix Coinages:**
	    
	    - **Microwaveable**
	    - **Gentrification**
	    - **Yuppiedom**
	    - **Leaderene**
	    - **Bagger**
	    - **Additive-free**
	    - **Homophobe**, **Homophobic**
	    - **User-friendliness**
	    - **Retrophilia**
	4. **Noun Suffixes:**
	    
	    - Most common suffixes form nouns. There are fewer suffixes for verbs and adverbs.
	    - **Example**: _Snob_ (concrete noun) vs. _Snobbery_ (abstract noun).
	5. **Focus on Productive Suffixes:**
	    
	    - The emphasis is on suffixes that continue to be productive in modern language, forming new words regularly.
2. ***==Verb Suffixes==***
	1. **-ify**
	    
	    - Examples: beautify, purify, classify, personify
	    - This suffix is used to form verbs from adjectives or nouns.
	2. **-ize / -ise**
	    
	    - Examples: capitalize, modernize, popularize, terrorize
	    - **-ize** is the most productive verb suffix in modern English, especially in American English. In British English, **-ise** is more common, though **-ize** is also used by some publishers like Oxford University Press.
	3. **Denominal -ate**
	    
	    - Examples: chlorinate, activate
	    - This suffix is still productive, particularly in scientific and technical terms.
	4. **De-adjectival -en**
	    
	    - Examples: quieten, strengthen
	    - This suffix is less productive today and is primarily used for forming verbs from adjectives.
	5. **Criticism of Suffix Use**
	    
	    - Some words ending in **-ize** or **-ise** are criticized for being associated with bureaucratic or formal writing (e.g., finalize, hospitalize, prioritize). Despite this, words like privatize have been accepted without much opposition.
	6. **Spelling Variants:**
	    
	    - In American English, **-ize** is the standard, while British English often uses **-ise**. However, **-ize** has gained acceptance in British English, especially in certain academic or formal contexts.
3. ***==Adjective Suffixes==***
	1. **-able**
	    
	    - Examples: readable, profitable, reliable
	    - This suffix is added to verbs to form adjectives meaning "able to be" or "worthy of."
	2. **-al, -ial**
	    
	    - Examples: accidental, managerial, musical
	    - These suffixes form adjectives that describe characteristics or qualities.
	3. **-ed**
	    
	    - Examples: cultured, heavy-handed, eagle-eyed
	    - This suffix is used to form adjectives from nouns or noun phrases, indicating a characteristic. Not to be confused with the past tense or past participle of verbs.
	4. **-ful**
	    
	    - Examples: powerful, careful, resentful
	    - Indicates "full of" or "characterized by."
	5. **-ic**
	    
	    - Examples: Arabic, aristocratic, dramatic
	    - This suffix is used to form adjectives that typically relate to a specific place, person, or quality.
	6. **-ish**
	    
	    - Examples: Swedish, feverish, youngish, moreish
	    - Conveys the meaning "having the characteristics of" or "somewhat like." It can also be used pejoratively (e.g., fiendish, brutish).
	7. **-less**
	    
	    - Examples: careless, harmless, restless
	    - Means "without" or "lacking."
	8. **-like**

		- **-ive** (e.g., attractive)

		- **-ory** (e.g., inflammatory)
		- **-ous** (e.g., monotonous)
		
	10. ***Additional Observations***
		- **-ed** as a suffix for adjectives is distinct from its use in past tense verbs. For example, "gable" becomes "gabled" (e.g., "gabled house").
		    
		- **-able** vs. **-ible**:
		    
		    - **-able** is used with native English words (e.g., drinkable), whereas **-ible** appears primarily in borrowed words from French or Latin (e.g., reversible).
		- **Pejorative Use of -ish**:
		    
		    - Words like **fiendish** and **brutish** carry negative connotations, whereas **childlike** has a neutral meaning compared to **childish**, which is pejorative.
		- **-ic** vs. **-ical**:
		    
		    - Some words contrast based on their suffix:
		        - **economic** (e.g., "economic theory") vs. **economical** (e.g., "economical lifestyle")
		        - **historic** (e.g., "historic building") vs. **historical** (e.g., "historical research")
