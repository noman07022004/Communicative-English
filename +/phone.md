a **phone** is the actual, physical version of a sound that can be produced in speech. It is the real, concrete manifestation of a speech sound, unlike the **[[phoneme]]**, which is the abstract, mental representation of that sound. Phones are represented in **square brackets** to indicate their physical articulation.

For example, the [[phoneme]] /t/ can have several different versions or "phones" depending on the context in which it is spoken:

- The \[t] sound in "tar" might be pronounced with aspiration (a puff of air).
- The \[t] in "star" might lack that aspiration.
- In "writer," the \[t] sound might become a **flap** (a very quick, single tap of the tongue).
- In "butter," the \t] might be pronounced as a **glottal stop** \[ʔ] in some accents.
- In "eighth," the \[t] might take on a **dental** articulation, making it sound like \[t̪].

These different realizations of the phoneme /t/ are all considered **phones** because they are the actual sounds produced in speech, and when grouped together, they are referred to as **[[allophone|allophones]]** of the /t/ phoneme.

Thus, **phones** are the physical, context-dependent variants of an abstract sound unit (phoneme), and they are distinguished by their acoustic or articulatory properties.
