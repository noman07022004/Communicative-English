### Introduction
- A **phone** is the actual, physical version of a sound that can be produced in speech. 
- It is the real, concrete manifestation of a speech sound, unlike the **[[phoneme]]**, which is the abstract, mental representation of that sound. 
- **Phone** is represented by **square brackets** (e.g., \[t\]), indicating the physical realization of the sound.
- For example, the [[phoneme]] /t/ can have several different versions or "phones" depending on the context in which it is spoken:
	- The \[t\] sound in "tar" might be pronounced with aspiration (a puff of air).
	- The \[t\] in "star" might lack that aspiration.
	- In "writer," the \[t\] sound might become a **flap** (a very quick, single tap of the tongue).
	- In "butter," the \[t\] might be pronounced as a **glottal stop** \[ʔ\] in some accents.
	- In "eighth," the \[t\] might take on a **dental** articulation, making it sound like \[t̪\].
- These different realizations of the phoneme /t/ are all considered **phones** because they are the actual sounds produced in speech, and when grouped together, they are referred to as **[[allophone|allophones]]** of the /t/ phoneme.
