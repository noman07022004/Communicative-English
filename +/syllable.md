### Syllables

- **Definition**: A syllable is a unit of speech that must contain a vowel or vowel-like sound, including diphthongs. It typically consists of two main parts:
    1. **Onset**: One or more consonants before the vowel.
    2. **Rhyme**: Composed of the **nucleus** (the vowel) and the **coda** (any consonants that follow the vowel).
    3. Syllable Structure![[syllable structure.jpeg]]
- **Types of Syllables**:
    - **Open Syllables**: These syllables have no coda and end in a vowel or vowel-like sound (e.g., _me_, _to_, _no_).
    - **Closed Syllables**: These syllables have a coda and end in one or more consonants (e.g., _up_, _cup_, _hat_).
- **Structure Examples**:
    
    - **CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant)**: _ham_, _not_, _like_.
    - **CCVC (Consonant-Consonant-Vowel-Consonant)**: _green_.
    - **V (Vowel)**: _I_.
    - **VCC (Vowel-Consonant-Consonant)**: _eggs_.
    - **VC (Vowel-Consonant)**: _am_.

### Consonant Clusters

- **Definition**: Consonant clusters refer to combinations of two or more consonants that occur together in the onset or coda of a syllable.
    
- **Onset Consonant Clusters**: In English, it's common for the onset to consist of more than one consonant.
    
    - **Example**: In the word _stop_, the onset is the consonant cluster /st/.
    - Other examples include: _black_, _bread_, _trick_, _twin_.
- **Coda Consonant Clusters**: A coda can also consist of more than one consonant.
    
    - **Example**: In the word _post_, the coda is the consonant cluster /st/.
- **Larger Onset Clusters**: English can have larger onset clusters, such as in words like _stress_ or _splash_, which have three initial consonants (CCC).
    
    - **Pattern**: In larger onset clusters, the first consonant is usually /s/, followed by a voiceless stop (/p/, /t/, /k/), and a liquid or glide (/l/, /r/, /w/).
    - **Example**: _splash_ (/splæʃ/), _strong_ (/strɔŋ/), _scream_ (/skriːm/), _squeeze_ (/skwiːz/).
- **Phonotactics of Clusters**: Phonotactics describe the constraints on where and how consonant clusters can appear within syllables in a language. In English, certain clusters like /spl/ and /str/ follow regular patterns, whereas others may be less common or forbidden by the language's phonotactic rules.
