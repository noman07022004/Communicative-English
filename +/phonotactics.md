### Introduction
- Phonotactics refers to the set of rules or constraints governing the possible combinations and sequences of sounds (phonemes) in a particular language. 
- These rules determine which sound combinations are permissible and which are not, shaping the sound structure of the language.
- **Examples**: In English, a sequence like _\[f Égl\]_ or _\[rnrgl\]_ is not allowed because it violates phonotactic rules. Meanwhile, combinations like _\[lig\]_ or _\[vig\]_, although not common, are possible English words because they follow the permissible phonotactic patterns of English.





### Basic Concepts
-  A speaker of a language unconsciously knows which sound combinations are possible in their language. This knowledge is a part of their **phonological competence** and governs the structure of words.
- Phonotactic constraints are closely linked to the structure of the syllable. The phonological unit of the syllable dictates where certain sounds can or cannot occur, influencing the overall phonotactic rules of the language.
