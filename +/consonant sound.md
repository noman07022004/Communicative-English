# Consonant Sounds
### Introduction

- A consonant sound is a speech sound that is produced by obstructing the airflow in some way, either partially or completely. 
- This can involve the tongue, teeth, lips, or other parts of the mouth. Examples of consonant sounds include "b," "d," "k," and "s." They are different from vowel sounds, which are produced with an open vocal tract.
