### According to the Text

- **Definition**:  
    An **allophone** is a variant or different version of a **phoneme** that occurs in specific phonetic contexts. Allophones are the actual physical realizations of the abstract phoneme.
    
- **Phoneme vs. Allophone**:
    
    - The **phoneme** is the abstract sound type, while **allophones** are the different spoken versions of that phoneme.
    - Allophones do not change the meaning of a word when substituted; they only result in a different pronunciation.
- **Examples of Allophones of /t/**:
    
    - **\[tʰ]** (aspirated \[t]) in words like _tar_.
    - **\[ɾ]** (flap \[t]) in words like _writer_.
    - **\[ʔ]** (glottal stop) in words like _butter_.
    - **\[t̪]** (dental \[t]) in words like _eighth_.

- **Distinction**:
    
    - Substituting one **phoneme** for another will result in a change of meaning (e.g., changing /t/ to /k/ makes "tar" into "car").
    - Substituting **allophones** for each other only results in a different pronunciation of the same word.
