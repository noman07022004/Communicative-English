A **phoneme** is the smallest unit of sound in a language that can distinguish meaning. Phonemes are abstract, mental representations of sounds rather than physical utterances. They form the foundation of phonology and help define the structure and rules of a language’s sound system.

### According to the book
- **Definition**:  
    A **phoneme** is a meaning-distinguishing sound in a language. It is an abstract unit that can have multiple physical versions (called phones), but they are all recognized as the same phoneme in the language.
    
- **Phoneme and Alphabetic Writing**:
    - When learning alphabetic writing, we are using the concept of the phoneme, where each phoneme is represented by a single written symbol.
    - For example, the phoneme **/t/** is represented by the written letter "t," and its different spoken versions (like \[t] in different contexts) are considered tokens of the same phoneme.

- **Notation**:
    - **Phoneme**: Represented by **slash marks** (e.g., /t/), indicating the abstract sound type.
    - **Phone**: Represented by **square brackets** (e.g., \[t]), indicating the physical realization of the sound.

- **Contrastive Function**:
    - An essential property of a phoneme is that it functions **contrastively**. This means that phonemes can create differences in meaning when substituted in words.
    - For example, in English, the phonemes **/f/** and **/v/** create a contrast in meaning:
        - **/f/** in "fat" vs **/v/** in "vat"
        - **/f/** in "fine" vs **/v/** in "vine"

- **Test for Identifying Phonemes**:
    - If changing one sound in a word causes a change in meaning, then the sounds are distinct phonemes. This is the basic test used to identify phonemes in a language.

### Phoneme vs. Allophone

|**Aspect**|**Phoneme**|**Allophone**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Abstract unit of sound.|Contextual variation of a phoneme.|
|**Function**|Distinguishes meaning.|Does not distinguish meaning.|
|**Example**|/t/ in English.|[tʰ] (aspirated) in "top" vs. [t] (unaspirated) in "stop."|

### Phoneme Representation

1. **[[IPA]] (International Phonetic Alphabet)**:
    
    - Standardized system to represent phonemes.
    - Example symbols:
        - /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/ (stops).
        - /i/, /u/, /æ/, /ɑ/ (vowels).
2. **[[Phonemic Transcription]]**:
    
    - Encodes only phonemic information, enclosed in slashes: /.../.
        - Example: /kæt/ for "cat."
3. **[[Phonetic Transcription]]**:
    
    - Includes allophonic and detailed phonetic information, enclosed in brackets: [...].
        - Example: \[kʰæt] for "cat."

Phonemes are the building blocks of language, crucial for understanding how sounds convey meaning. Their study reveals the cognitive and linguistic structures underlying spoken communication and bridges phonology with other linguistic disciplines.
