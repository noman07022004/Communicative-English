### Introduction
- A **phoneme** is a meaning-distinguishing sound in a language.
- Phonemes are abstract, mental representations of sounds rather than physical utterances. 
- They form the foundation of phonology and help define the structure and rules of a language’s sound system.
- It is an abstract unit that can have multiple physical versions called [[phone|phones]], but they are all recognized as the same phoneme in the language.
- For example, the phoneme **/t/** is represented by the written letter "t," and its different spoken versions (like \[t\] in different contexts) are considered tokens of the same phoneme.
- **Phoneme** is represented by **slash marks** (e.g., /t/), indicating the abstract sound type.

### Basic Concepts
1. **Contrastive Function**:
    - An essential property of a phoneme is that it functions **contrastively**. This means that phonemes can create differences in meaning when substituted in words.
    - For example, in English, the phonemes **/f/** and **/v/** create a contrast in meaning:
        - **/f/** in "fat" vs **/v/** in "vat"
        - **/f/** in "fine" vs **/v/** in "vine"
2. **Test for Identifying Phonemes**:
    - If changing one sound in a word causes a change in meaning, then the sounds are distinct phonemes. This is the basic test used to identify phonemes in a language.

### Phoneme vs. Allophone

|**Aspect**|**Phoneme**|**Allophone**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Abstract unit of sound.|Contextual variation of a phoneme.|
|**Function**|Distinguishes meaning.|Does not distinguish meaning.|
|**Example**|/t/ in English.|[tʰ] (aspirated) in "top" vs. [t] (unaspirated) in "stop."|

### Phoneme Representation

1. **[[IPA]] (International Phonetic Alphabet)**:
    
    - Standardized system to represent phonemes.
    - Example symbols:
        - /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/ (stops).
        - /i/, /u/, /æ/, /ɑ/ (vowels).
2. **[[Phonemic Transcription]]**:
    
    - Encodes only phonemic information, enclosed in slashes: /.../.
        - Example: /kæt/ for "cat."
3. **[[Phonetic Transcription]]**:
    
    - Includes allophonic and detailed phonetic information, enclosed in brackets: \[...\].
        - Example: \[kʰæt] for "cat."

Phonemes are the building blocks of language, crucial for understanding how sounds convey meaning. Their study reveals the cognitive and linguistic structures underlying spoken communication and bridges phonology with other linguistic disciplines.
