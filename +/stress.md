3. **Functions of Stress in English**
	1. ***Distinguishing Word Meaning***
	    
	    - Stress can differentiate between nouns and verbs:
	        - Noun: _REcord_ (stress on the first syllable).
	        - Verb: _reCORD_ (stress on the second syllable).
	2. ***Sentence-Level Meaning***
	    
	    - Stress also operates at the sentence level to emphasize important words or change meaning:
	        - _I didn’t say HE stole the book_ (emphasizes "he" implies someone else did).
	        - _I didn’t SAY he stole the book_ (emphasizes "say" implies a different action).
	3. ***Rhythm and Intelligibility***
	    
	    - English is a **stress-timed language**, meaning stressed syllables occur at roughly equal intervals, making stress critical to natural rhythm.
