### Introduction
- The **base** is the part of a word to which affixes are added.
-  It provides the central meaning and serves as the foundation for creating new words. 
- For example,
	- **Root**: **doubt**
	- **Base 1**: **doubted** (verb, past tense)
	- **Base 2**: **undoubted** (adjective, negated)
	- **Base 3**: **undoubtedly** (adverb)

### **Key Characteristics of a Base**

1. **Core Structure**: The base provides the foundation of the word and holds its essential meaning.
2. **Attachment Point**: Prefixes and suffixes are added to the base to modify or refine its meaning.
3. **Can Include Roots**: A base may be identical to a root (if no affixes are added) or may include a root along with one or more affixes.

### **Types of Bases**

#### 1. **Simple Base**

- When the base is a free morpheme and can stand alone as a word.
- **Example**:
    - In _happy_, the base is _happy_.

#### 2. **Complex Base**

- When the base includes a root and one or more affixes.
- **Example**:
    - In _unhappiness_:
        - The base is _unhappy_ (root: _happy_, prefix: _un-_).

### **Base vs. Root**

- **Base**: Broader term that includes the root and any affixes already attached.
- **Root**: The most fundamental part of a word, which cannot be broken down further.

**Example**:

- In _recapturing_:
    - **Root**: _capt_.
    - **Base**: _recapture_ (root _capt_ + affix _re-_).
