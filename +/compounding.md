### Introduction
- **Compounding** is the process of combining two or more individual words to form a new single word with a distinct meaning.
- The components of a compound word can be both **free [[morpheme|morphemes]]** (words that can stand alone) and **bound [[morpheme|morphemes]]** (morphemes that can't stand alone).
- **Compounds** are new words made by joining two or more words (or bases) together. They can be **closed**, **hyphenated**, or **open**, and the meaning of the compound is often derived from the meanings of its parts.
- ***Types of Compounds:***
	1. **Closed Compounds**: The words are written together without spaces or hyphens.
	    
	    - Examples: **toothbrush**, **notebook**, **sunflower**.
	2. **Hyphenated Compounds**: The words are connected with a hyphen.
	    
	    - Examples: **mother-in-law**, **check-in**, **well-being**.
	3. **Open Compounds**: The words are written separately but function as a single concept.
	    
	    - Examples: **ice cream**, **post office**, **high school**.

## Basic Concepts

### **Compounds vs. Phrases**

1. **Compound**: A compound is a word made up of two or more bases, like _postcard_, _blackbird_, or _toothbrush_. These represent specific concepts found in a dictionary and refer to objects or specific entities.
2. **Phrase**: A phrase consists of two or more grammatically related words. Examples include _large card_ or _black board_, where the words retain individual meanings and are not considered a single concept.

### **Conceptual Difference**

1. **Compounds**: Often name a class or object by a defining feature (e.g., _cooking apples_ = apples for cooking, _sleeping pill_ = a type of pill).
2. **Phrases**: Describe a characteristic that can apply to any item (e.g., _rotting apples_ = apples that are rotting).

### **Orthographic Practice**

1. **Compounds**: Can be written as solid (e.g., _postcard_) or hyphenated (e.g., _bird-watching_).
2. **Variations**: Some compounds are written with spaces or hyphens but are still considered compounds, like _hotdog_ or _hayfever_.
3. **Examples of different spellings**:
    - **Paper knife**: open, hyphenated (paper-knife), solid (paperknife)
    - **Ceasefire**: open, hyphenated (cease-fire)

### **Stress Patterns**

1. **Main stress on the first base** (typical of compounds):
    - Examples: _'blackbird_, _'databank_, _'travel agent_ (when written as two words).
2. **Main stress on the second word** (typical of phrases):
    - Examples: _good 'conference_, _personal agent_.
3. **British vs. American English**:
    - British: _hot 'dog_, _class-' conscious_
    - American: _hot dog_, _'class-conscious_
4. **Compounds with an adjective or adverb + participle**:
    - Examples: _flat-'footed_, _well-'meaning_.

### **Exceptions and Ambiguities**

- Some place names like street names have stress on the second base (e.g., _Edgware 'Road_, _Park Lane_).
- Stress patterns should not be solely relied upon to determine if a word is a compound.

### **Final Consideration**

- A combination of conceptual meaning, spelling, and stress patterns should be used to decide if a word is a compound.

    - **Back-formation**: Removal of suffix (e.g., _babysit_ from _babysitting_).
4. **Adverbs**:
    - Examples: _good-naturedly_, _however_, _nowadays_.

### **Special Notes**

1. **Conversion and Back-formation**: Many compound verbs come from nouns via conversion or back-formation (e.g., _blackmail_, _cold-shoulder_, _babysit_).
2. **Prepositions and Semi-Auxiliaries**: Some are not strict compounds, as their parts can be separated by other words (e.g., _because of_, _going to_).
