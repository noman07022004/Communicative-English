### Introduction
- **Prefixation** is the process of adding a **[[prefix]]** to the **beginning** of a [[base]] word to create a new word with a modified meaning. 
- Prefixes are [[morpheme|morphemes]] (the smallest units of meaning) that do not stand alone as words but alter the meaning of the base word when added. This process helps in forming words that express negation, direction, time, size, or other concepts.
### Basic Concepts



### Key Points about Prefixation:

- The **prefix** is attached **before** the base word.
- The addition of a prefix generally **does not change** the grammatical category of the base word (e.g., a noun remains a noun, a verb remains a verb, etc.).
- Prefixes often **change the meaning** of the base word, such as making it negative, showing reversal, or indicating time or quantity.

### Examples of Prefixation:

1. **Negative Prefixes**:
    
    - **Un-**: _unhappy_ (not happy)
    - **In-**: _incomplete_ (not complete)
    - **Dis-**: _dislike_ (not like)
2. **Reversal/Direction Prefixes**:
    
    - **Re-**: _redo_ (do again)
    - **Un-**: _unlock_ (reverse the action of locking)
    - **Ex-**: _exit_ (go out, or the act of leaving)
3. **Time/Place Prefixes**:
    
    - **Pre-**: _preview_ (view before)
    - **Post-**: _postwar_ (after the war)
4. **Size/Amount Prefixes**:
    
    - **Sub-**: _submarine_ (underwater)
    - **Super-**: _superhuman_ (beyond human ability)
5. **Degree/Intensification Prefixes**:
    
    - **Over-**: _overcooked_ (cooked too much)
    - **Under-**: _underestimate_ (estimate too low)

### Characteristics of Prefixation:

- **Class-maintaining**: Prefixation typically **maintains** the part of speech of the original word. For example:
    - _Happy_ (adjective) → _Unhappy_ (still an adjective)
    - _Like_ (verb) → _Dislike_ (still a verb)
- **Meaning-changing**: The addition of a prefix changes the **meaning** of the word. For example:
    - _Do_ → _Undo_ (reversal)
    - _Kind_ → _Unkind_ (negation)

Prefixation is one of the most common and productive ways of forming new words in English.
