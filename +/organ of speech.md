The **organs of speech** are parts of the human body involved in producing the sounds of speech. These organs work together to manipulate airflow, create sound, and shape it into distinct speech sounds.

### Classification of Speech Organs

Speech organs can be categorized based on their role in the speech production process:

1. **Respiratory Organs**: Responsible for generating and controlling airflow.
2. **Phonatory Organs**: Involved in the production of voice (phonation).
3. **Articulatory Organs**: Shape and modify the sound to create specific speech sounds.

## The Human Vocal Tracts

### 1. **Respiratory Organs**

These organs provide the necessary airflow for speech production.

- **Lungs**: Act as the air reservoir and power source for speech.
- **Diaphragm**: Helps control the release of air from the lungs.
- **Trachea (Windpipe)**: Channels air from the lungs to the larynx.

---

### 2. **Phonatory Organs**

These organs create the sound source for speech through the vibration of vocal folds.

- **Larynx (Voice Box)**: Houses the vocal cords, which vibrate to produce voiced sounds (e.g., **/b/**) or remain apart for voiceless sounds (e.g., **/p/**).
- **Vocal Folds (Cords)**: Thin membranes that can vibrate, stretch, or come together to produce different sound qualities.
- **Glottis**: The space between the vocal folds, involved in glottal sounds and controlling voicing.

### 3. **Articulatory Organs**

These organs shape and modify the sound produced by the phonatory system to create specific speech sounds.

#### **Active Articulators** (Moveable):

1. **Tongue**: The most versatile organ, used for creating a wide variety of sounds. Divided into:
    - **Tip**: Produces dental and alveolar sounds (e.g., **/t/**, **/n/**).
    - **Blade**: Used for sounds like **/ʃ/** in "shoe."
    - **Body**: Shapes vowel sounds (e.g., **/i/**, **/u/**).
    - **Root**: Influences the resonance in the pharynx.
2. **Lips**: Create bilabial sounds (e.g., **/p/**, **/b/**) and rounded vowels (e.g., **/u/**).
3. **Velum (Soft Palate)**: Controls airflow to the nasal cavity. Raised for oral sounds, lowered for nasal sounds (e.g., **/m/**, **/n/**).
4. **Lower Jaw (Mandible)**: Helps open and close the mouth.

#### **Passive Articulators** (Stationary):

1. **Teeth**: Help produce dental sounds (e.g., **/θ/** in "think").
2. **Alveolar Ridge**: The bony ridge behind the upper front teeth, used for alveolar sounds (e.g., **/t/**, **/d/**).
3. **Hard Palate**: The roof of the mouth, used for palatal sounds (e.g., **/j/** in "yes").
4. **Uvula**: A small, fleshy extension of the soft palate, involved in uvular sounds in some languages.

### Supporting Cavities

1. **Oral Cavity**: Shapes most speech sounds through movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw.
2. **Nasal Cavity**: Used for nasal sounds (e.g., **/m/**, **/n/**, **/ŋ/**) by directing airflow through the nose.
3. **Pharynx**: Acts as a resonating chamber that contributes to the quality of speech sounds.

### Speech Production Process

1. **Airflow**: Air is expelled from the lungs.
2. **Phonation**: The larynx modifies the airflow to produce voiced or voiceless sounds.
3. **Articulation**: Active and passive articulators shape the airflow to form distinct sounds.

### Example in English

- The sound **/t/** in "top":
    - **Respiratory**: Air is pushed out from the lungs.
    - **Phonatory**: The vocal folds are open (voiceless sound).
    - **Articulatory**: The tongue tip contacts the alveolar ridge to stop the airflow and releases it abruptly.

### Importance of Understanding Speech Organs

1. **Language Learning**: Helps in accurately producing sounds of new languages.
2. **Speech Therapy**: Identifies and corrects speech disorders.
3. **Linguistic Research**: Explores sound patterns across languages.
4. **Speech Technology**: Aids in designing accurate speech recognition systems.
