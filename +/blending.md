### Introduction
- **Blending** is the process of combining parts of two words to create a new word. 
- In blending, we typically take the beginning of one word and join it with the end of another.
- This process results in a term that represents a combination of the two original words. 
- for example,
	- smog (smoke + fog)
	- brunch (breakfast + lunch)
	- motel (motor + hotel)
	- Blog (web + log)
	- Modem (modular + demodulator)
	- Bit (binary + digit)


### Basic Concept

### Common Types of Blends:

1. **First part from one word, last part from another**:
    
    - **Brunch** (from _breakfast_ + _lunch_)
    - **Motel** (from _motor_ + _hotel_)
    - **Smog** (from _smoke_ + _fog_)
    - **Blog** (from _web_ + _log_)
2. **Combining parts of more than two words**:
    
    - **Infomercial** (from _information_ + _commercial_)
    - **Spork** (from _spoon_ + _fork_)
3. **Shortening and combining**:
    
    - **Glamping** (from _glamorous_ + _camping_)
    - **Frenemy** (from _friend_ + _enemy_)

### In Summary:

**Blends** are words formed by combining parts of two (or more) existing words. The goal is to create a new word that carries a meaning derived from the combination of the original terms. Blending is often used for creating catchy, memorable terms, especially in modern, informal, or creative contexts.
