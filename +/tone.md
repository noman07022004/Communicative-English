# Tone and tone languages
In the previous section, we discussed different types of **intonation** that can occur in one-syllable utterances like "yes" and "no." These include:

1. **Level Tone**: The pitch remains steady.
2. **Falling Tone**: The pitch drops from high to low.
3. **Rising Tone**: The pitch rises from low to high.

We used a simple notation system to represent these tones, with symbols placed before the syllables to indicate the type of tone:

- **Level tone**: _yes, _no
- **Falling tone**: Nyes, xno
- **Rising tone**: 'yes, /no

While this system can be expanded to show **high** and **low** levels of tone (e.g., **_yes** for low level and **-yes** for high level), English does not rely on such distinctions for meaning. In other words, changing the pitch in these examples doesn't change the fundamental meaning of "yes" or "no" in English. However, in many other languages, changing the pitch or tone of a word can **completely change its meaning**.

---

### **Tone Languages**

Languages in which tone plays a critical role in distinguishing word meanings are called **tone languages**. In these languages, the **pitch** or **tone** assigned to a syllable can determine the word's meaning. The meaning of a word may shift drastically with a change in tone.

#### Example of Tone in **Kono** (a language from West Africa):

- **High level tone**: _beq ('uncle')
- **Low level tone**: _buu ('horn')
- **Low level tone**: _beq ('greed')
- **High level tone**: _buu ('to be cross')

This shows how a **tone shift** from high to low (or vice versa) can alter the meaning of the same sequence of sounds. In **Mandarin Chinese**, for example, the word **"ma"** can take different meanings depending on its tone:

- **_ma** means "mother."
- **/ma** means "hemp."
- **xma** means "scold."

#### English vs. Tone Languages:

In contrast to **tone languages**, **English** does not use pitch variations to change the meaning of a word. Although **intonation** in English can change the **emphasis**, **emotion**, or **questioning tone**, it does not result in distinct meanings for the same word (unlike tone languages). For instance, English speakers can say **"yes"** with a falling tone (indicating certainty), or a rising tone (indicating a question), but the core meaning of the word "yes" does not change.

---

### **Conclusion: English vs. Tone Languages**

English is not a tone language, meaning that **intonation** in English serves more to convey emotions, intentions, and questions, rather than altering the word's inherent meaning. On the other hand, in **tone languages**, tone is an essential feature of the language, and altering the tone can change the very meaning of a word. Tone languages are widespread, spoken by large populations in **Southeast Asia**, **Africa**, and **Native American languages**, while English uses **intonation** to help convey additional nuance or emotion.

# Complex tones and pitch height
In the previous section, we discussed the **level**, **fall**, and **rise** tones used in English one-syllable utterances. However, English also features more complex tones, such as:

1. **Fall-Rise Tone**: The pitch first falls and then rises again. This tone is quite common in English and is used to convey various meanings, such as uncertainty, hesitation, or to soften a statement.
    
2. **Rise-Fall Tone**: The pitch starts low and rises before falling again. This tone is less common in everyday speech but may occur in specific contexts, such as when expressing surprise or when emphasizing a point.

### **Speaker’s Pitch Range and Intonation**

Each speaker has a **normal pitch range**, which includes:

- **Top level**: The highest pitch normally used by the speaker.
- **Bottom level**: The lowest pitch normally used by the speaker.

In regular, unemotional speech, the **intonation** generally stays within the lower part of the speaker's pitch range. However, when there is a need to express **strong emotions** or emphasis, speakers often extend their pitch range, using **extra pitch height**.

---

### **Emphasizing Pitch Height**

When expressing emphasis or strong emotions, a speaker may push their pitch beyond the normal range. For example:

- A **normal, unemphatic "yes"** might fall within the speaker's typical pitch range.
- A **strong, emphatic "yes"** might extend to the upper end of the pitch range, creating a more pronounced rise in pitch.

To visually represent this difference, the following symbols can be used:

- **\yes**: Indicates a normal "yes" within the regular pitch range.
- **tx yes**: Indicates an emphatic "yes" with extra pitch height.

### **Usage of Extra Pitch Height**

While many tones can be given extra pitch height, this is typically reserved for situations with **strong feelings**. Since this course focuses on **normal, unemotional speech**, the symbol for extra pitch height (represented by a vertical upward arrow) will be used sparingly.

---

### **Summary**

In summary, English has both **simple** (level, rise, fall) and **complex** (fall-rise, rise-fall) tones. Each speaker has a **normal pitch range**, and in situations of emphasis or strong emotions, speakers may use **extra pitch height**. This extra height adds depth and emphasis to speech, but is not always used in regular speech patterns.

# Some functions Of English tones
### **Functions of English Tones**

In the context of **English intonation**, different tones serve various linguistic functions. This section examines how tones can convey specific meanings in simple one-syllable utterances like "yes" and "no" when spoken in isolation.

---

#### **1. Fall Tone (xyes, xno)**

- **Function**: The fall tone is typically seen as **neutral** and conveys a sense of **finality** or conclusion.
- **Example**: If someone asks a question and the response is **xyes** or **xno**, it implies that the conversation is concluded and no further information is expected. This tone is often used when no more elaboration is needed.

---

#### **2. Rise Tone (zyes, zno)**

- **Function**: The rise tone suggests that **something more is to follow**. It can be seen as an **invitation to continue** or a prompt for further interaction.
- **Example 1**:
    - A: Excuse me.
    - B: **zyes** (implying "what do you want?").
- **Example 2**:
    - A: Do you know John Smith?
        
    - B: **zyes** (signaling the willingness to continue and perhaps provide more information).
        
    - Conversely, a **fall** would signal **finality**.
        
- **Function with "no"**:
    - A: Have you seen Ann?
    - B: **zno** (inviting A to explain why they are asking).

---

#### **3. Fall-Rise Tone (vyes, vno)**

- **Function**: The fall-rise tone often indicates **limited agreement** or a **response with reservations**. This tone conveys both **concession** and **hesitation**.
- **Example 1**:
    - A: I've heard it's a good school.
    - B: **vyes** (implying partial agreement but with reservations).
- **Example 2**:
    - A: It’s not really an expensive book, is it?
    - B: **vno** (signifying partial disagreement or uncertainty).

---

#### **4. Rise-Fall Tone (ayes, ano)**

- **Function**: The rise-fall tone is used to express **strong feelings** such as **approval**, **disapproval**, or **surprise**.
- **Example 1**:
    - A: You wouldn’t do an awful thing like that, would you?
    - B: **ano** (indicating disapproval or surprise).
- **Example 2**:
    - A: Isn’t the view lovely!
    - B: **ayes** (expressing strong approval or enthusiasm).

---

#### **5. Level Tone (_yes, _no)**

- **Function**: The level tone is used in contexts where the response is **routine**, **uninspiring**, or **boring**. It conveys a sense of **monotony** or **lack of emotion**.
- **Example**:
    - A teacher calling the names of students from a register might use the level tone. When a student's name is called, the response is likely to be **_yes**.
    - Similarly, when answering a series of **routine** questions (e.g., for an insurance policy), the response might be **_no** for questions like “Do you suffer from any serious illness?”

---

### **Tone Substitution and Flexibility**

Although we have described specific functions for each tone, it is important to note that no single tone is restricted to only one context. While certain tones may be **more likely** in particular situations, **tone substitution** is common, and the context plays a crucial role in determining which tone is most appropriate. The meaning of a tone can shift depending on the speaker's intent, emotion, and the overall conversation.

---

### **Conclusion**

The tones in English, from **fall** to **rise**, **fall-rise**, and **rise-fall**, all contribute to the **functionality** of the language in communicating **emotions**, **intentions**, and **interpersonal dynamics**. Understanding these subtle shifts in pitch is crucial for effective communication, as tones often carry more significance than the words themselves.

# Tones on other words

Now that we have explored tones in **one-syllable words** like "yes" and "no," we can extend this understanding to **polysyllabic words**. The tone on polysyllabic words is typically applied to the **most strongly stressed syllable**. This is important because the tone often coincides with the stress pattern in a word. Here’s how the different tones can be applied to words of varying syllabic lengths:

---

#### **1. Fall Tone (x)**

The **fall** tone typically conveys a **final**, **definitive**, or **certain** feeling.

- **Examples**:
    - **xstQP** (could imply finality or a conclusion)
    - **xcighty** (suggests a definitive statement)
    - **xgain** (could imply a definite action or conclusion)

---

#### **2. Rise Tone (/**)

The **rise** tone often signals a **question**, **uncertainty**, or an **invitation to continue**.

- **Examples**:
    - **/ surg** (suggesting a rising tone of inquiry)
    - **/ rally** (could imply a rising intonation, indicating a question or uncertainty)
    - **/ toznight** (a rising tone could suggest curiosity or question)

---

#### **3. Rise Tone on Lists**

When giving a list, speakers typically use the **rise tone** on each item until the last item, which has a **fall tone** to signal the end of the list. This pattern helps to indicate that the list is still ongoing.

- **Example**:
    - "You can have it in **'Ed**, **blue**, **zgcgn**, or **Nhlack**."
    - In this example, each item on the list is spoken with a rising tone, and the final item "Nhlack" is spoken with a falling tone, marking the conclusion of the list.

---

#### **4. Fall-Rise Tone (v)**

The **fall-rise** tone often conveys **uncertainty**, **hesitation**, or a **reservation**.

- **Examples**:
    - **v perhaps** (indicating a hesitant or uncertain agreement or suggestion)
    - **v nearly** (suggesting doubt or a reserved response)

---

#### **5. Rise-Fall Tone (a)**

The **rise-fall** tone often sounds **surprised**, **impressed**, or **emphatic**. This tone suggests a strong emotional reaction or unexpected response.

- **Examples**:
    - **a Qh** (a surprised or impressed reaction)
    - **a Algygly** (could express surprise or enthusiasm)
    - **a Ammense** (suggesting excitement or surprise)

---

### **Summary of Tone Applications on Words**

- **Fall Tone**: Finality or definiteness.
- **Rise Tone**: Questions, curiosity, or invitation to continue.
- **Rise Tone in Lists**: Continuation of items with a final fall tone at the end of the list.
- **Fall-Rise Tone**: Uncertainty, hesitation, or reserved agreement.
- **Rise-Fall Tone**: Surprise, emphasis, or strong emotional reaction.

By applying these tonal patterns, speakers of English can convey various nuances of meaning, ranging from certainty to hesitation or surprise, even within a simple word.
