### Introduction
- The **root** is the core part of a word that carries the fundamental meaning
- A root is the simplest form of a word; you cannot break it down into smaller meaningful parts.
- The root carries the primary, essential meaning of the word.
- In some cases, a root can stand alone as a word, but in others, it must combine with affixes (prefixes or suffixes) to form a complete word.
- For example,
	- **Free Roots** (Can stand alone as words):
		- **Happy** → Root in **happiness**, **unhappy**, **happily**.
		- **Help** → Root in **helpful**, **helpless**, **unhelpful**.
	- **Bound Roots** (Cannot stand alone as words):
		- **capt** → Root in **capture**, **captive**, **recapture**.
		- **Aud** → Root in **audio**, **audible**, **auditorium**, **audition**.

### **Key Characteristics of a Root**

1. **Core Meaning**: 
2. **Independence**: In some cases, a root can stand alone as a word, but in others, it must combine with affixes (prefixes or suffixes) to form a complete word.
3. **Cannot Be Further Divided**: A root is the simplest form of a word; you cannot break it down into smaller meaningful parts.

### **Examples of Roots**

#### 1. **Root that Can Stand Alone**

- Some roots are independent words by themselves.
- **Examples**:
    - _Book_ (root: _book_).
    - _Play_ (root: _play_).
    - _Love_ (root: _love_).

#### 2. **Root that Cannot Stand Alone**

- Some roots need to be combined with other morphemes (prefixes or suffixes) to form a complete word.
- **Examples**:
    - _Capt_ in _capture_ (capt is the root, but it cannot stand alone).
    - _Struct_ in _construct_ (struct is the root, but it needs the prefix _con-_ and suffix _-t_).

### **Root vs. Base**

- **Root**: The most basic form of the word, from which other forms are derived. It carries the main meaning and may not always be a standalone word.
- **Base**: A broader term that refers to the part of the word to which affixes are added. The base may include the root along with attached affixes.

**Example**:

- In _unhappiness_:
    - **Root**: _Happy_ (core meaning).
    - **Base**: _Unhappy_ (root _happy_ + prefix _un-_).

### **Common Roots from Greek and Latin**

Many English words derive from roots in Greek and Latin. These roots provide the foundation for words across many languages.

#### **Examples from Greek/Latin**:

- **Bio** (Greek): life
    - _Biology_ (study of life).
    - _Biography_ (story of someone's life).
- **Tele** (Greek): far
    - _Telephone_ (a device for transmitting sound over a distance).
    - _Television_ (a device for transmitting images over a distance).

### **Summary**

The **root** is the core, irreducible part of a word, providing its essential meaning. While some roots can stand alone as independent words, others must be combined with prefixes or suffixes to form full words. Understanding the root helps in grasping the meaning and structure of complex words.
