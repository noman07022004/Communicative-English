# Manner of Articulation
### Introduction
- The **manner of articulation** refers to how the airflow is modified or manipulated as it passes through the vocal tract during the production of speech sounds. 
- It’s about how we use parts of the articulatory organs (such as the tongue, lips, teeth, etc.)   to shape the sound.
### Types of Manner of Articulation
1. **Plosives (Stops)**: Complete closure, followed by a burst of air (e.g., **/p/**, **/t/**, **/k/**).
2. **Fricatives**: Partial constriction, causing turbulent airflow (e.g., **/f/**, **/s/**, **/ʃ/**).
3. **Affricates**: Combination of a stop and a fricative (e.g., **/tʃ/**, **/dʒ/**).
4. **Nasals**: Air is directed through the nose (e.g., **/m/**, **/n/**, **/ŋ/**).
5. **Liquids**: Partial closure, smooth airflow (e.g., **/l/**, **/r/**).
6. **Glides**: Similar to vowels, but occur in consonantal positions (e.g., **/j/**, **/w/**).
