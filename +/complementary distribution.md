### According to the Text

- **Definition**:  
    **Complementary distribution** occurs when two [[allophone|allophones]] of the same [[phoneme]] appear in different environments (positions in words), and their occurrence does not overlap.
    
- **Example**:
    
    - The [[aspirated]] \[th] version of the phoneme /t/ (as in **tar**) is used at the beginning of a word (word-initially).
    - The non-aspirated \[t] version of /t/ (as in **star**) occurs after another consonant.
    - These two versions of the phoneme /t/ never occur in the same environment, so they are in complementary distribution.
