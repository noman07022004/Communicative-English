### Coarticulation Effects

- **Coarticulation** refers to the overlapping articulation of adjacent speech sounds during normal, rapid speech. Instead of producing each sound in isolation, the articulators move from one sound to the next without pause.

### Assimilation

- **Definition**: Assimilation is the process where one sound becomes more similar to a neighboring sound, often for ease of articulation.
- **Example**: In the phrase _"I have to go"_, the /v/ in _have_ may be assimilated to a voiceless /f/ due to the following voiceless /t/, resulting in _"hafta"_.
- **Rule**: Sounds may change to become more like a neighboring sound, such as from voiced to voiceless.

### Nasalization

- **Definition**: Nasalization occurs when vowels are influenced by adjacent nasal consonants, causing the vowel to take on a nasal quality.
- **Example**: In words like _pin_ or _pan_, the vowel is nasalized because of the following nasal consonant.
- **Rule**: Any vowel becomes nasal when immediately followed by a nasal consonant.

### Elision

- **Definition**: Elision is the omission of a sound, often in casual speech, to ease pronunciation.
- **Example**: In _"you and me"_, the /d/ sound in _and_ is often elided, resulting in _"you an' me"_.
- **Other examples**: _"friendship"_ may be pronounced as _"fren'hip"_, and _"every"_ may be pronounced as _"ev'ry"_.
- **Note**: Elision is common in consonant clusters, especially in coda position, where sounds like /t/ may be omitted.

### Summary Table: Coarticulation Effects

| **Effect**       | **Description**                                                | **Example**                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Assimilation** | Sound segments become more similar to neighboring ones.        | _"have to"_ → _"hafta"_         |
| **Nasalization** | Vowels take on a nasal quality before a nasal consonant.       | _"pin"_ → _[pɪ̃n]_              |
| **Elision**      | Sounds are omitted in casual speech for ease of pronunciation. | _"you and me"_ → _"you an' me"_ |

### Normal Speech

- These phonological processes (assimilation, nasalization, and elision) are natural parts of everyday speech and should not be seen as mistakes or laziness. They are essential for fluent and efficient communication, and avoiding them would lead to overly deliberate and unnatural speech. The goal of studying these processes is to understand the regular patterns in speech, not to dictate how a language _should_ be pronounced.

**Phonological Rules**

Phonological rules explain how phonemes are realized as specific sounds (allophones) in given linguistic environments.

- **Assimilation:** One sound becomes similar to a neighboring sound.
    - Example: "input" often pronounced as [ɪnpʊt] → [ɪmpʊt].
- **Deletion:** A sound is omitted.
    - Example: "friend" pronounced as [frɛnd] → [frɛn].
- **Insertion (Epenthesis):** A sound is added.
    - Example: "athlete" pronounced as [æθliːt] → [æθəlit].
- **Metathesis:** Sounds are reordered.
    - Example: "ask" pronounced as [æsk] → [æks].
