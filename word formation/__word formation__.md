# Word Formation

**Word formation** is the linguistic process by which new words are created or existing words are modified to produce new meanings. It involves various methods and principles that allow languages to expand their vocabularies and adapt to new concepts, technologies, and cultural influences.

### **Key Characteristics of Word Formation**
1. **Creative Process**
    - It enables the creation of entirely new words or variations of existing ones.
2. **Dynamic**
    - It evolves over time, adapting to cultural, technological, and social changes.
3. **Rule-Governed**
    - It follows specific linguistic rules to ensure comprehensibility and grammatical consistency.

### **Types of Word Formation**

1. **[[affixation|Affixation]]**
    
    - Adding [[prefix|prefixes]] (by the process of [[prefixation]]) or [[suffix|suffixes]] (by the process of [[suffixation]]) to a [[base]] or [[root]].
        - _Unhappy_ (_un-_ + _happy_).
        - _Happiness_ (_happy_ + _-ness_).
1. **[[compunding|Compounding]]**
    
    - Combining two or more bases to form a single word.
        - _Notebook_, _blackboard_, _mother-in-law_.
3. **[[conversion|Conversion]]**
    
    - Changing the word class without altering its form.
        - _Email_ (noun) → _email_ (verb).
        - _Google_ (noun) → _google_ (verb).
4. **[[blending|Blending]]**
    
    - Merging parts of two words to create a new one.
        - _Brunch_ (_breakfast_ + _lunch_).
        - _Smog_ (_smoke_ + _fog_).
5. **[[clipping|Clipping]]**
    
    - Shortening a longer word to form a shorter version.
        - _Gym_ (_gymnasium_), _ad_ (_advertisement_).
6. **[[borrowing|Borrowing]]**
    
    - Adopting words from other languages.
        - _Piano_ (Italian), _karaoke_ (Japanese).
7. **[[back-formation|Back-Formation]]**
    
    - Removing what appears to be an affix from a word to create a new word.
        - _Editor_ → _edit_.
        - _Television_ → _televise_.
8. **[[reduplication|Reduplication]]**
    
    - Doubling a word or part of it, sometimes with slight variation.
        - _Bye-bye_, _zigzag_.
9. **[[acronym|Acronyms]] and [[initialism|Initialisms]]**
    
    - Forming words from the initial letters of phrases.
        - Acronyms: _NASA_ (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).
        - Initialisms: _FBI_ (Federal Bureau of Investigation).
10. **[[neologism|Neologism]]**
    
    - Inventing entirely new words.
    - Example: _Selfie_, _googling_.
11. [[combining form|Combining form]]
    
	- A **combining form** is a bound morpheme, usually from Latin or Greek, that combines with other morphemes (roots or other combining forms) to create new words. Unlike affixes, combining forms cannot stand alone as words. They are commonly used in **scientific, technical, or academic terms**.
		- **Examples of initial combining forms**: _bio-_ (life), _tele-_ (distance), _psycho-_ (mind).
		- **Examples of final combining forms**: _-ology_ (study of), _-phobia_ (fear of), _-graph_ (writing or recording).
	- They help form complex terms like _biology_ (bio- + -ology), _telephone_ (tele- + phone), and _psychology_ (psycho- + -ology).
12. [[miscellaneous|Miscellaneous]]
	- **Miscellaneous word formation** includes various ways of creating new words that don't fit standard categories like affixation or compounding:
		1. **[[reduplication|Reduplication]]**: Repeating parts of words (e.g., _chit-chat_).
		2. **[[acronym|Acronyms]]**: Using initial letters of phrases (e.g., _YOLO_).
		3. **Onomatopoeia**: Words that imitate sounds (e.g., _buzz_).
		4. **Eponyms**: Words from people's names (e.g., _sandwich_).
		5. **[[back-formation|Back-formation]]**: Creating new words by removing affixes (e.g., _edit_ from _editor_).
		6. **Coinage**: Creating entirely new words (e.g., _Google_).
		7. **Semantic Extension**: Words taking on new meanings (e.g., _mouse_).
		8. **Loan Translations**: Direct translations from other languages (e.g., _skyscraper_ from French).
		9. **Functional Shift**: Shifting word categories without changing form (e.g., _Google_ as a verb).
