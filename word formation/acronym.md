**Acronyms** are words formed from the initial letters of a series of words or a phrase, where the letters are typically pronounced as a single word. Acronyms are often used for convenience and efficiency, especially in technical fields, organizations, or when referring to long names or phrases.

### Key Characteristics of Acronyms:

- **Initial letters**: Acronyms are usually formed from the first letters of each word in a phrase.
- **Pronounced as words**: The resulting acronym is pronounced as a single word (e.g., _NASA_, _radar_).
- **Familiarity**: Acronyms are often used to simplify long or complex terms, making them easier to remember or reference.
- **Common in everyday language**: Many acronyms have become so familiar that they are used as regular words.

### Examples of Acronyms:

1. **NASA**: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
2. **UNESCO**: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
3. **RADAR**: Radio Detection and Ranging
4. **SCUBA**: Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus
5. **LASER**: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
6. **FOMO**: Fear of Missing Out (informal, commonly used on social media)

### Acronyms vs. Initialisms:

- **Acronyms**: Formed from initial letters and pronounced as a word (e.g., _NASA_, _scuba_).
- **Initialisms**: Formed from the initial letters, but each letter is pronounced individually (e.g., _FBI_ = Federal Bureau of Investigation, _ATM_ = Automated Teller Machine).

### In Summary:

**Acronyms** are created by taking the first letters of words in a phrase and combining them to form a new word that is pronounced as a single unit. They are commonly used for efficiency, especially in technical, academic, or organizational contexts.
