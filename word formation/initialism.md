### Initialism

**Definition**:  
An **initialism** is a type of abbreviation formed by taking the initial letters of a series of words and pronouncing them individually (letter by letter) rather than as a single word.

### Characteristics:

- Each letter is pronounced separately.
- Often used for names, organizations, or technical terms.

### Examples:

- **FBI**: Federal Bureau of Investigation
- **ATM**: Automated Teller Machine
- **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language
- **UN**: United Nations

### Comparison with Acronyms:

- **Initialism**: Letters are pronounced individually (e.g., _FBI_ → "F-B-I").
- **Acronym**: Letters form a new word that is pronounced as a whole (e.g., _NASA_ → "nah-sah").

Initialisms are widely used in both formal and informal language for brevity and clarity.
