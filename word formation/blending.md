**Blends** are a type of word formation where parts of two (or more) words are combined to create a new word. The parts typically come from the beginning of one word and the end of another, and the resulting blend often combines the meanings of the original words. Blending is a popular process in creating new terms, especially in **informal language** or **popular culture**.

### Characteristics of Blends:

- **Combination of parts**: Blends mix parts of two or more words, often taking the initial part of one word and the final part of another.
