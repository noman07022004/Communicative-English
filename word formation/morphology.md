### Introduction
- **Morphology** is the branch of linguistics that studies the [[structure of word|structure]] and [[Word Formation Process|formation]] of words. It examines how words are composed of smaller units called **[[morpheme|morphemes]]**, which are the smallest meaningful units of language.

### Key Concepts in Morphology:

1. **[[morpheme|Morpheme]]**: The smallest unit of meaning (e.g., _un-, happy, -ness_ in _unhappiness_).
    
    - **Free morphemes**: Can stand alone as words (e.g., _book, run_).
    - **Bound morphemes**: Must attach to other morphemes (e.g., _-s, un-_).
2. **Word Formation Processes**: How new words are created.
    
    - **Affixation**: Adding prefixes or suffixes (e.g., _re-play_).
    - **Compounding**: Combining two words (e.g., _toothbrush_).
    - **Conversion**: Changing the word's category without altering its form (e.g., _to email_ from _email_).
    - **Clipping, blending, and acronyms**: Shortening or merging words.
3. **Inflection vs. Derivation**:
    
    - **Inflection**: Modifies a word to express grammatical features like tense, case, or number (e.g., _walks, walking_).
    - **Derivation**: Creates new words with new meanings by adding affixes (e.g., _happiness, redo_).

Morphology is crucial for understanding how languages evolve and how meaning is constructed in communication.
