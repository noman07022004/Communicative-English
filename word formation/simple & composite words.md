### **Simple Words and Composite Words**

**Simple words** and **composite words** are two categories in the structure of words based on their internal complexity. Here's what distinguishes them:

---

### **Simple Words**

- **Definition**: Words that cannot be broken down into smaller meaningful parts.
- **Structure**: These words consist of a single [[morpheme]] (the smallest unit of meaning).
- **Examples**:
    - _And_, _if_, _on_, _the_.
    - These words carry meaning on their own without being divisible into smaller components.

**Key Characteristics**:

1. **No Internal Structure**: They lack prefixes, suffixes, or roots.
2. **Basic Building Blocks**: Often foundational to the language.

### **Composite Words**

- **Definition**: Words that have a recognizable internal structure and can be divided into smaller meaningful parts.
- **Structure**: These words are formed by combining one or more morphemes, such as roots, bases, prefixes, or suffixes.

**Types of Composite Words**:

1. **Derived Words** (with prefixes/suffixes):
    
    - _Unhappy_ (_un-_ + _happy_).
    - _Happily_ (_happy_ + _-ly_).
2. **Compound Words** (with multiple bases):
    
    - _Notebook_ (_note_ + _book_).
    - _Mother-in-law_ (_mother_ + _in-law_).

### **Comparison**

| *Feature*        | *Simple Words*    | *Composite Words*        |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Structure**    | Single morpheme   | Multiple morphemes       |
| **Divisibility** | Cannot be divided | Can be broken into parts |
| **Examples**     | _And_, _if_, _on_ | _Unhappy_, _blackboard_  |

### **Summary**

- **Simple Words** are indivisible units of meaning.
- **Composite Words** are made up of multiple meaningful parts, often created through processes like **affixation** or **compounding**.  
    These distinctions help explain how words are built and how new words are formed.
