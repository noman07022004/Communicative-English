### **Affix**

An **affix** is a [[morpheme]] that is added to a root or base word to modify its meaning or create a new word. Affixes cannot stand alone as words by themselves and always attach to a base or root word. There are three main types of affixes: **prefixes**, **suffixes**, and **infixes**.

### **Types of Affixes**

1. **[[prefix|Prefix]]**
    
    - A **prefix** is an affix that is added **before** the root or base word.
    - It modifies the meaning of the word by changing its sense or adding a particular nuance.
    - **Examples**:
        - _Un-_ in _unhappy_ (negates the meaning of _happy_).
        - _Re-_ in _redo_ (means "again" or "back").
        - _Pre-_ in _preheat_ (means "before").
2. **[[suffix|Suffix]]**
    
    - A **suffix** is an affix that is added **after** the root or base word.
    - Suffixes often change the word class (e.g., from a noun to an adjective, or from a verb to a noun).
    - **Examples**:
        - _-ly_ in _happily_ (changes the adjective _happy_ to an adverb).
        - _-ness_ in _happiness_ (changes the adjective _happy_ to a noun).
        - _-able_ in _readable_ (changes the verb _read_ to an adjective meaning "able to be read").
3. **Infix** (Rare in English)
    
    - An **infix** is an affix that is inserted **within** the root or base word.
    - Infixes are less common in English, but they are more frequently used in some other languages.
    - **Example in English** (informal/slang usage):
        - _Un-freaking-believable_ (inserting _-freaking-_ within the word _unbelievable_ for emphasis).

### **Function of Affixes**

- **Modify Meaning**: Affixes often change the meaning of the base word.
    
    - _Dis-_ in _disagree_ (changes the meaning of _agree_ to its opposite).
    - _Over-_ in _overcook_ (implies excessive cooking).
- **Change Word Class**: Some affixes change the grammatical category of a word.
    
    - _-ly_ changes an adjective (e.g., _slow_) into an adverb (e.g., _slowly_).
    - _-ness_ changes an adjective (e.g., _happy_) into a noun (e.g., _happiness_).
- **Form New Words**: Affixes are used to create entirely new words.
    
    - _-er_ in _teacher_ (a person who teaches).
    - _-ed_ in _baked_ (past tense of the verb _bake_).

### **Summary**

An **affix** is a morpheme that attaches to a root or base word to change its meaning or grammatical form. There are three main types of affixes: **prefixes** (added before the root), **suffixes** (added after the root), and **infixes** (inserted within the root). Affixes play a crucial role in word formation by modifying meaning, creating new words, and changing word classes.
