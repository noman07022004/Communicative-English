**Compounds** are words formed by combining two or more smaller words (or bases) to create a new word with a distinct meaning. The components of a compound word can be both **free morphemes** (words that can stand alone) and **bound morphemes** (morphemes that can't stand alone).

### Types of Compounds:

1. **Closed Compounds**: The words are written together without spaces or hyphens.
    
    - Examples: **toothbrush**, **notebook**, **sunflower**.
2. **Hyphenated Compounds**: The words are connected with a hyphen.
    
    - Examples: **mother-in-law**, **check-in**, **well-being**.
3. **Open Compounds**: The words are written separately but function as a single concept.
    
    - Examples: **ice cream**, **post office**, **high school**.

### How Compounds Work:

- **Meaning**: The meaning of a compound word often relates to the meanings of its parts, but it can also be more specific or different.
    
    - Example: _toothbrush_ = a brush for teeth, _sunflower_ = a flower that faces the sun.
- **Types of Bases**: Compounds can be formed from different types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
    
    - **Noun + Noun**: _toothbrush_, _football_.
    - **Adjective + Noun**: _blackboard_, _old-fashioned_.
    - **Verb + Noun**: _toothpaste_, _swimsuit_.

### In Summary:

**Compounds** are new words made by joining two or more words (or bases) together. They can be **closed**, **hyphenated**, or **open**, and the meaning of the compound is often derived from the meanings of its parts.
