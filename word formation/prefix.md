### **Prefix**

A **prefix** is a type of **affix** that is added **at the beginning** of a base or root word. Prefixes do not change the word class of the base word (unlike suffixes, which often do), but they modify the meaning of the word. Prefixes can indicate negation, time, position, direction, or other kinds of relationships.

### **Functions of Prefixes**

1. **Negation**:  
    Prefixes can add a **negative** meaning to a word.
    
    - _un-_ in _unhappy_ (not happy)
    - _in-_ in _incomplete_ (not complete)
    - _dis-_ in _disagree_ (not agree)
2. **Indicating Reversal or Removal**:  
    Prefixes can suggest the **reversal** or **removal** of something.
    
    - _un-_ in _untie_ (reverse of tie)
    - _de-_ in _defrost_ (remove frost)
    - _dis-_ in _disconnect_ (remove connection)
3. **Indicating Time or Frequency**:  
    Prefixes can denote time or how often something happens.
    
    - _pre-_ in _preheat_ (before heat)
    - _re-_ in _revisit_ (do again)
    - _post-_ in _postpone_ (after, delay)
4. **Position or Direction**:  
    Prefixes can describe **position** or **direction**.
    
    - _sub-_ in _submarine_ (underwater)
    - _inter-_ in _international_ (between nations)
    - _trans-_ in _transport_ (across or beyond)
5. **Degree or Size**:  
    Some prefixes indicate **intensity**, **degree**, or **size**.

### **Prefix in Word Formation**

Prefixes play an important role in **word formation** by modifying the meaning of the base word. The word **class** (part of speech) of the base word typically stays the same, but the **meaning** is altered:

1. **From Adjective to Adjective (Negation)**:
    
    - _un-_ in _unhappy_ (not happy)
    - _in-_ in _incomplete_ (not complete)
2. **From Verb to Verb (Reversal)**:
    
    - _re-_ in _replay_ (to play again)
    - _dis-_ in _disagree_ (not agree)
3. **From Noun to Noun (Position or Direction)**:
    
    - _sub-_ in _subway_ (under, below the ground)
    - _inter-_ in _intervention_ (between, among people)
4. **From Noun to Verb (Action or Change)**:
    
    - _de-_ in _defrost_ (remove frost)
    - _en-_ in _enable_ (to make able)

### **Summary**

A **prefix** is an affix added to the **beginning** of a base or root word. It changes the meaning of the base word without changing its grammatical class. Prefixes can indicate negation (un-, dis-), repetition (re-), time (pre-, post-), position (sub-, inter-), and many other meanings. Prefixes are a powerful tool in word formation, allowing speakers to modify existing words to create new ones with different nuances.
