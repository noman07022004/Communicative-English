### **Suffix**

A **suffix** is a type of affix that is added **at the end** of a base word or root. It alters the meaning or grammatical category of the word. Suffixes are essential for word formation because they often change a word’s part of speech (e.g., from a noun to an adjective or from a verb to a noun).
