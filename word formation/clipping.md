**Clipping** is a word-formation process where a longer word is shortened by removing one or more syllables, typically without changing the meaning. The resulting word is often more casual or informal but retains the original meaning of the longer word.

Clipping is a common process in **spoken language**, especially for convenience or ease of use.

### Types of Clipping:

1. **Fore-clipping**: Removing the beginning of a word.
    
    - Example: _telephone_ → _phone_.
    - Example: _advertisement_ → _ad_.
2. **Back-clipping**: Removing the end of a word.
    
    - Example: _laboratory_ → _lab_.
    - Example: _refrigerator_ → _fridge_.
3. **Middle-clipping**: Removing parts from both the beginning and the end.
    
    - Example: _influenza_ → _flu_.
    - Example: _mathematics_ → _math_.
4. **Complex Clipping**: Combining parts of two words.
    
    - Example: _motor + hotel_ → _motel_.
    - Example: _breakfast + lunch_ → _brunch_.

### Characteristics of Clipping:

- **Casual tone**: Clipped words often have a more informal or conversational tone.
- **Efficiency**: Clipping makes words shorter and quicker to say or write.
- **Not always standardized**: Some clipped forms become widely accepted (like _phone_), while others remain informal or slang (like _veggie_ for _vegetable_).

### Examples of Clipping:

- **Car** (from _automobile_)
- **Photo** (from _photograph_)
- **Fridge** (from _refrigerator_)
- **TV** (from _television_)
- **Flu** (from _influenza_)
- **Gym** (from _gymnasium_)

### In Summary:

**Clipping** involves shortening a word by cutting off parts of it, typically for convenience or informality. It can involve removing the beginning (fore-clipping), the end (back-clipping), or both (middle-clipping) of a word. Clipped forms are common in casual speech and writing.
