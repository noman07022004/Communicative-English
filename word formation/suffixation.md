**Suffixation** is the process of adding a **suffix** to the **end** of a base word to form a new word. Suffixes are morphemes that are attached to the end of a root or base word and typically **change the word's meaning** or **grammatical category** (such as turning a noun into an adjective, or a verb into a noun).

### Key Points about Suffixation:

- The **suffix** is added **after** the base word.
- Suffixes often **change the grammatical class** of the word, such as turning a verb into a noun or an adjective into an adverb.
- Suffixation is used to create a wide range of new words, particularly to form different parts of speech or express grammatical tense, number, or degree.

### Examples of Suffixation:

1. **Forming Nouns**:
    
    - **-ness**: _happiness_ (from _happy_)
    - **-tion**: _celebration_ (from _celebrate_)
    - **-er**: _worker_ (from _work_)
    - **-ment**: _enjoyment_ (from _enjoy_)
2. **Forming Adjectives**:
    
    - **-ful**: _beautiful_ (from _beauty_)
    - **-less**: _hopeless_ (from _hope_)
    - **-ous**: _dangerous_ (from _danger_)
    - **-al**: _magical_ (from _magic_)
3. **Forming Verbs**:
    
    - **-ize**: _realize_ (from _real_)
    - **-en**: _hasten_ (from _haste_)
    - **-ify**: _simplify_ (from _simple_)
4. **Forming Adverbs**:
    
    - **-ly**: _quickly_ (from _quick_)
    - **-ward**: _forward_ (from _forward_)
5. **Forming Comparative or Superlative Adjectives**:
    
    - **-er**: _smarter_ (from _smart_)
    - **-est**: _fastest_ (from _fast_)

### Characteristics of Suffixation:

- **Class-changing**: Suffixation often changes the **part of speech** of the word. For example:
    
    - _Kind_ (adjective) → _Kindness_ (noun)
    - _Read_ (verb) → _Readable_ (adjective)
- **Meaning-changing**: The addition of a suffix can **alter the meaning** of the word, often indicating a change in **degree**, **number**, or **tense**. For example:
    
    - _Active_ → _Activity_ (from adjective to noun)
    - _Achieve_ → _Achievement_ (from verb to noun)
    - _Govern_ → _Government_ (from verb to noun)
- **Productivity**: Some suffixes are **more productive** than others. This means that certain suffixes are used more frequently to form new words, such as the **-ness** suffix for forming nouns from adjectives (e.g., _happiness_, _kindness_).
    

### Summary:

Suffixation is a powerful word-formation process in English that allows for the creation of new words by adding suffixes to the end of base words. This process can change the **grammatical category** of the word (like turning a noun into an adjective) or modify its meaning in terms of tense, number, degree, etc.
