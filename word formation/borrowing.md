### Types of Borrowing:

1. **Direct Borrowing**: The word is taken almost unchanged.
    - Example: _piano_ (from Italian), _kindergarten_ (from German).
2. **Calque (Loan Translation)**: A phrase is translated literally into the borrowing language.
    - Example: _skyscraper_ (translated from French _gratte-ciel_).
3. **Modified Borrowing**: The word is adapted to match the borrowing language's phonology or grammar.
    - Example: _ballet_ (from French, but pronounced differently in English).

### Why Borrowing Happens:

1. **Cultural Influence**: Adopting words for new concepts (e.g., _sushi_ from Japanese).
2. **Trade and Exploration**: Exchange of goods and ideas introduces new terms (e.g., _tea_ from Chinese).
3. **Science and Technology**: Adoption of specialized terms (e.g., _robot_ from Czech).

Borrowing enriches a language, reflecting its interaction with other cultures and its historical and social development.
