The **conditioning of allomorphs** refers to the factors that determine which allomorph of a morpheme is used in a particular context. There are three main types of conditioning: **phonetic (or phonological), lexical, and grammatical**.

---

### **1. Phonetic (Phonological) Conditioning**

The choice of allomorph depends on the phonetic environment, specifically the sounds surrounding the morpheme.

#### Examples:

- **Plural Morpheme in English**:
    
    - _/s/_ after voiceless consonants (_cats_).
    - _/z/_ after voiced consonants (_dogs_).
    - _/ɪz/_ after sibilant sounds (_buses_).
- **Past Tense Morpheme in English**:
    
    - _/t/_ after voiceless sounds (_walked_).
    - _/d/_ after voiced sounds (_played_).
    - _/ɪd/_ after /t/ or /d/ sounds (_wanted_).

#### Rule:

The form of the allomorph is determined by the sound immediately preceding it.

### **2. Lexical Conditioning**

The choice of allomorph depends on specific words or lexical items. It is unpredictable and must be memorized as part of the word's meaning.

#### Examples:

- **Plural Morpheme in Irregular Nouns**:
    
    - _child_ → _children_.
    - _ox_ → _oxen_.
    - _foot_ → _feet_.
    - These irregular forms cannot be predicted by general rules.
- **Past Tense in Irregular Verbs**:
    
    - _go_ → _went_.
    - _eat_ → _ate_.
    - _sing_ → _sang_.

#### Rule:

The selection of the allomorph is tied to specific lexical items, often involving irregular or suppletive forms.

---

### **3. Grammatical (Morphological) Conditioning**

The choice of allomorph is determined by the grammatical context, such as tense, number, or case.

#### Examples:

- **Definite Article in German**:
    
    - _der_ (masculine nominative singular).
    - _die_ (feminine nominative singular or plural).
    - _das_ (neuter nominative singular).
    - The choice depends on the gender, case, and number of the noun.
- **English Comparatives**:
    
    - Adjectives: _-er_ (e.g., _taller_).
    - Adverbs: _more_ (e.g., _more carefully_).

#### Rule:

The allomorph is chosen based on grammatical rules rather than phonetic environment or specific lexical items.

### Summary Table:

|**Conditioning Type**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Phonetic (Phonological)**|Determined by surrounding sounds|Plurals: _cats_, _dogs_.|
|**Lexical**|Depends on specific words or irregular forms|_child_ → _children_.|
|**Grammatical**|Chosen based on grammatical context|_taller_ vs. _more careful_.|

These types of conditioning help explain the variability in morpheme realization across languages.
