**Affixation** is the **linguistic process** of attaching an **[[affix]]** (a [[prefix]], [[suffix]], [[infix]], or [[circumfix]]) to a **[[base]]** or **[[root]] word** in order to create a new word or modify the meaning of the original word. It is one of the primary methods of **word formation** in many languages, including English.

### Key Aspects of Affixation:

1. **Affixes** are the **[[morpheme|morphemes]]** that attach to a base word. They can be added to the beginning, end, middle, or both ends of a word, depending on the type of affix:
    
    - **[[prefix|Prefix]]**: Added at the beginning of a word (e.g., _un-_ in _undo_).
    - **[[suffix|Suffix]]**: Added at the end of a word (e.g., _-ly_ in _happily_).
    - **[[infix|Infix]]**: Inserted within a word (less common in English but seen in some languages).
    - **[[circumfix|Circumfix]]**: Added to both the beginning and end of a word (rare in English but present in other languages).
2. **Purpose of Affixation**: The goal of affixation is usually to **change the meaning**, **alter the word class** (e.g., from noun to adjective or from verb to noun), or to add **grammatical features** like tense or number.
    
    - **Meaning Change**: Adding the prefix _un-_ to _happy_ creates _unhappy_, changing the meaning to "not happy."
    - **Class Change**: Adding the suffix _-ness_ to the adjective _happy_ creates _happiness_, changing the word from an adjective to a noun.
    - **Grammatical Change**: Adding the suffix _-ed_ to the verb _walk_ creates _walked_, indicating past tense.
3. **Types of Affixation**:
    
    - **Derivational Affixation**: When an affix is added to create a new word with a different meaning or a different grammatical category (e.g., turning the verb _run_ into the noun _runner_ by adding the suffix _-er_).
    - **Inflectional Affixation**: When an affix is added to indicate grammatical features like tense, number, case, or comparison without changing the word's category (e.g., adding _-s_ to make a noun plural, like _cats_ from _cat_).

### Example of Affixation:

- **[[prefixation|Prefixation]]**:
    
    - **Affix**: _un-_
    - **Base Word**: _happy_
    - **Resulting Word**: _unhappy_ (changing the meaning to "not happy")
- **[[suffixation|Suffixation]]**:
    
    - **Affix**: _-ness_
    - **Base Word**: _happy_
    - **Resulting Word**: _happiness_ (changing the word from an adjective to a noun)
- **Infixation** (though rare in English):
    
    - **Affix**: _-in-_
    - **Base Word**: _friend_
    - **Resulting Word**: _fiend_ (changing the word by inserting an infix to create a new word, in this case through historical language change).

### Summary:

**Affixation** is the **process** of attaching **affixes** (prefixes, suffixes, etc.) to **[[base]] words** to create new words, change meanings, or adjust grammatical features.
