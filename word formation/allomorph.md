An **allomorph** is a variation of a morpheme that occurs in different contexts but retains the same meaning or function. These variations arise due to phonological, grammatical, or contextual reasons.

### Key Points About Allomorphs:

1. **Same Morpheme, Different Forms**: Allomorphs are different realizations of the same morpheme.
    
    - Example: The plural morpheme in English has three allomorphs:
        - _/s/_ as in _cats_.
        - _/z/_ as in _dogs_.
        - _/ɪz/_ as in _buses_.
2. **Phonologically Conditioned Allomorphs**: The form of the allomorph depends on the surrounding sounds.
    
    - Example: English plural suffix:
        - _/s/_ follows voiceless sounds (e.g., _cats_).
        - _/z/_ follows voiced sounds (e.g., _dogs_).
        - _/ɪz/_ follows sibilant sounds (e.g., _buses_).
3. **Morphologically Conditioned Allomorphs**: The form depends on grammatical or morphological context.
    
    - Example: Past tense in English:
        - Regular verbs: _/t/_ (e.g., _walked_), _/d/_ (e.g., _played_), _/ɪd/_ (e.g., _wanted_).
        - Irregular verbs: _go_ → _went_, _eat_ → _ate_.
4. **Suppletion**: Extreme form of allomorphy where the allomorphs have completely different forms.
    
    - Example: _go_ → _went_ (past tense).

### Example Breakdown:

- **Word**: _children_
    - Morpheme: Plural.
    - Allomorph: _-ren_ (an irregular plural marker).

Allomorphs are essential in understanding how language adapts to phonetic and grammatical environments while maintaining meaning.
