### **Base**

The **base** of a word is the part to which affixes (prefixes, suffixes, or both) are attached. It carries the primary meaning of the word and can be either a free morpheme (a word that can stand alone) or a bound morpheme (a word segment that cannot stand alone but needs affixes to make sense).

### **Key Characteristics of a Base**

1. **Core Structure**: The base provides the foundation of the word and holds its essential meaning.
2. **Attachment Point**: Prefixes and suffixes are added to the base to modify or refine its meaning.
3. **Can Include Roots**: A base may be identical to a root (if no affixes are added) or may include a root along with one or more affixes.

### **Types of Bases**

#### 1. **Simple Base**

- When the base is a free morpheme and can stand alone as a word.
- **Example**:
    - In _happy_, the base is _happy_.

#### 2. **Complex Base**

- When the base includes a root and one or more affixes.
- **Example**:
    - In _unhappiness_:
        - The base is _unhappy_ (root: _happy_, prefix: _un-_).

### **Base vs. Root**

- **Base**: Broader term that includes the root and any affixes already attached.
- **Root**: The most fundamental part of a word, which cannot be broken down further.

**Example**:

- In _recapturing_:
    - **Root**: _capt_.
    - **Base**: _recapture_ (root _capt_ + affix _re-_).

### **Examples of Bases in Words**

|Word|Base|Prefix|Suffix|Root|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Happiness**|_Happy_|None|_-ness_|_Happy_|
|**Unlikely**|_Likely_|_Un-_|_-ly_|_Like_|
|**Replaying**|_Replay_|_Re-_|_-ing_|_Play_|
|**Undoubtedly**|_Undoubted_|_Un-_|_-ly_|_Doubt_|

### **Summary**

The **base** is the part of a word to which affixes are added. It provides the central meaning and serves as the foundation for creating new words. While it often overlaps with the root, the base can also include affixes that are part of the word's structure.
