**Back-formation** is the process of creating a new word by removing a perceived affix (prefix or suffix) from an existing word. The result is often a word that seems to fit a certain word class, but may not have originally existed in that form. In other words, back-formation takes a longer word (usually a noun or adjective) and removes part of it to create a simpler word (typically a verb or noun).

### How Back-Formation Works:

- The word is typically **simplified** by removing an affix, but this removal might not be etymologically accurate.
- The newly formed word often takes on a different grammatical category (e.g., creating a verb from a noun).

### Examples of Back-Formation:

1. **Noun to Verb**:
    
    - _Editor_ → _Edit_ (The noun _editor_ leads to the verb _edit_, though "edit" did not originally come from _editor_).
    - _Donation_ → _Donate_.
    - _Worker_ → _Work_ (Though "work" was not originally derived from "worker," the back-formation gives the verb _work_ a new sense).
2. **Adjective to Noun**:
    
    - _Healthy_ → _Health_ (Removing the -y to form the noun).
    - _Lazy_ → _Laziness_ (Though _laziness_ comes from _lazy_, it's created by back-formation).
3. **Verb to Noun**:
    
    - _To impact_ (verb) → _Impact_ (noun) – here, the verb "impact" has been formed by back-formation from the noun.
    - _To burgle_ → _Burglar_ (Here, _burgle_ has been formed by removing the suffix from _burglar_).

### Characteristics of Back-Formation:

- **Not always etymologically correct**: The new word may seem logically derived but may not be historically or linguistically accurate.
- **Common in modern language**: Back-formation is often used in **informal language** or in the creation of **new words** for modern needs.
- **Productive process**: It is a common way for English to form new words, especially in response to evolving language and technology.

### In Summary:

**Back-formation** is the creation of a new word by removing a perceived affix from an existing word. This process often results in a word that belongs to a different word class (e.g., a verb from a noun). It's a creative and productive way to form new words in English.
