**Conversion** (also called **zero derivation**) is the process of changing a word from one **word class** (part of speech) to another without changing its form. In other words, conversion allows a word to shift categories (e.g., from a noun to a verb or from an adjective to a noun) without adding any affixes or altering its structure.

### Examples of Conversion:

1. **Noun to Verb**:
    
    - _email_ (noun) → _to email_ (verb)
    - _text_ (noun) → _to text_ (verb)
    - _google_ (noun) → _to google_ (verb)
2. **Verb to Noun**:
    
    - _run_ (verb) → _a run_ (noun)
    - _drive_ (verb) → _a drive_ (noun)
    - _sleep_ (verb) → _a sleep_ (noun)
3. **Adjective to Noun**:
    
    - _clean_ (adjective) → _the clean_ (noun, referring to cleanliness)
    - _free_ (adjective) → _the free_ (noun, referring to freedom)
4. **Adjective to Verb**:
    
    - _empty_ (adjective) → _to empty_ (verb)
    - _dry_ (adjective) → _to dry_ (verb)

### Characteristics of Conversion:

- **No change in form**: Unlike processes like affixation (which require adding prefixes or suffixes), conversion changes the function of the word without modifying its appearance.
- **Flexible and common**: Conversion is a highly productive process in English, especially in modern contexts, where new verbs, nouns, or adjectives often emerge.

### In Summary:

**Conversion** is the process where a word changes its grammatical category (e.g., noun to verb, verb to noun) without changing its form, allowing the same word to serve different roles in a sentence. It is a common and flexible way to form new words in English.
