**Reduplication** is a word-formation process where a part of a word, or the entire word, is repeated, sometimes with slight modifications. It is often used to create new words, add emphasis, or convey a playful or informal tone.

### Types of Reduplication:

1. **Exact Reduplication**: The entire word is repeated without changes.
    
    - Examples: _bye-bye_, _yo-yo_.
2. **Partial Reduplication**: Only part of the word is repeated, often with a change in sound.
    
    - Examples: _hanky-panky_, _zigzag_.
3. **Modified Reduplication**: A repeated word is slightly altered for rhythmic or stylistic effect.
    
    - Examples: _criss-cross_, _tick-tock_.

Reduplication is more common in some languages, like Indonesian or Tagalog, where it can indicate grammatical features such as pluralization or intensity.
