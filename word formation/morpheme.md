A **morpheme** is the smallest unit of meaning in a language. It cannot be divided into smaller parts that have meaningful content or serve a grammatical purpose. Morphemes are the building blocks of words and play a fundamental role in the study of linguistics, particularly in **morphology**.

### **Key Features of Morphemes**

1. **Meaningful Unit**: Each morpheme carries meaning or a grammatical function.
2. **Indivisibility**: A morpheme cannot be broken down into smaller meaningful parts.
3. **Combination**: Morphemes can be combined to form words.

### **Types of Morphemes**

#### 1. **Free Morphemes**

- **Definition**: Morphemes that can stand alone as independent words.
- **Examples**:
    - _Book_, _run_, _happy_, _cat_.
- **Usage**: These words have meaning by themselves and do not need to be attached to other morphemes.

#### 2. **Bound Morphemes**

- **Definition**: Morphemes that cannot stand alone and must be attached to a free morpheme to have meaning.
- **Examples**:
    - Prefixes: _un-_ (as in _unhappy_), _re-_ (as in _replay_).
    - Suffixes: _-ed_ (as in _played_), _-ness_ (as in _kindness_).
- **Usage**: These modify the meaning or function of a free morpheme.

### **Other Types Based on Function**

1. **Lexical Morphemes**
    
    - Convey concrete meanings, like objects or actions.
    - Examples: _tree_, _run_, _love_.
2. **Grammatical Morphemes**
    
    - Indicate grammatical relationships or functions.
    - Examples: _-s_ (plural marker), _-ed_ (past tense marker).
3. **Derivational Morphemes**
    
    - Create new words or change the word class.
    - Examples: _un-_ (makes _happy_ into _unhappy_), _-ly_ (makes _quick_ into _quickly_).
4. **Inflectional Morphemes**
    
    - Modify a word's tense, number, aspect, or comparison without changing its word class.
    - Examples: _-s_ (plural: _cats_), _-ing_ (progressive: _running_), _-er_ (comparative: _faster_).

### **Examples of Morphemes in Words**

1. **Unhappiness**
    
    - _Un-_ (prefix, bound morpheme): negative meaning.
    - _Happy_ (root, free morpheme): expresses the main idea.
    - _-ness_ (suffix, bound morpheme): turns an adjective into a noun.
2. **Dogs**
    
    - _Dog_ (free morpheme): refers to the animal.
    - _-s_ (bound morpheme): indicates plural.

### **Summary**

A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language. It can be **free** (standalone) or **bound** (attached to another morpheme). Morphemes help us understand the structure of words and the way they carry meaning.
