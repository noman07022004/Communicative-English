2. **Blending**: Combining parts of words (e.g., _brunch_ = breakfast + lunch).
3. **Compounding**: Joining two words (e.g., _laptop_ = lap + top).
4. **Affixation**: Adding prefixes or suffixes (e.g., _unfriend_).
5. **Conversion**: Changing the grammatical category of an existing word (e.g., _text_ [noun] â†’ _to text_ [verb]).
