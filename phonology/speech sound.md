Phonetic transcription is the process of writing down the sounds of speech using a standardized system, such as the **International Phonetic Alphabet ([[IPA]])**. The IPA provides a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols, allowing for accurate representation of speech sounds across different languages. Each symbol in the IPA corresponds to a specific sound, whether it's a consonant or a vowel.
